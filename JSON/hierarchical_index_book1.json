To pass, a thesis must demonstrate logical, \nstructured, and defensible reasoning based on credible and verifiable evidence presented in such \na way that it makes an original contribution to\nknowledge, as judged by experts in the field. Among the many types of scholarly\nproductions, theses are an oddity: each one is different, and there are no standard\nor generic constructions. Most of those who supervise theses have written just one,\nand, despite the effort they take to produce, the only people who carefully read\na given thesis are the project supervisors, the examiners, and an otherwise rather\nselect audience of specialized academics.\nFrom the start, it is good to have a solid idea of what a thesis is, and perhaps the\nbest place to start a discussion of theses is with their purpose. What do examiners\nlook for when they judge your work?\n\n1.2Criteria for Examination\n When universities send out a thesis for examination, they include their suggested\nguidelines for the examiners. I recommend that you get a copy of these guidelines\nfrom your own university (they are almost certainly available online) and look them\nover carefully. Make an effort, too, to understand the process of submission and\nexamination.\nAt my university, the University of Melbourne < unimelb.edu.au >, the guidelines begin by \nlisting key attributes of a successful thesis (quoted from the university’s \nSchool of Graduate Research website, as of November 2010):\n\n1.3Attributes of a Successful Thesis\n The thesis demonstrates authority in the candidate’s field and shows evidence of\ncommand of knowledge in relevant fields.\nIt shows that the candidate has a thorough grasp of the appropriate methodological techniques \nand an awareness of their limitations.It makes a distinct contribution to knowledge.Its contribution \nto knowledge rests on originality of approach and/or interpretation of the findings and, in some cases, \nthe discovery of new facts.It demonstrates an ability to communicate research findings effectively in the\nprofessional arena and in an international context.It is a careful, rigorous and sustained piece of work \ndemonstrating that a research ‘apprenticeship’ is complete and the holder is admitted to the community\nof scholars in the discipline.\nAt first glance these guidelines may appear to refer to the thesis, but they are really\nabout the candidate. The first point makes this explicit: ‘The thesis demonstrates\nauthority in the candidate’s field’. And consider the last point. The examiner has to\nconsider whether the thesis ‘is a careful, rigorous and sustained piece of work’—but\nsee how it goes on—‘demonstrating that a research “apprenticeship” is complete\nand the holder is admitted to the community of scholars in the discipline’.\nAt the start of introductory seminars in thesis writing, I ask students to explain\nthe purpose of a thesis. Often they say something like, ‘To tell people in my area\nabout my research’. No doubt your research is of interest, but your primary purpose\nin writing a thesis is to pass an examination. These examiners are not reading your\nwork out of mere interest: from the above criteria, we see that examiners read your\nthesis to assess whether or not you have demonstrated your fitness to be admitted\nto a community of scholars. Because a written thesis is an examination paper, not\nsimply a report of research findings, you need to understand what examiners are\nlooking for when they read your work. In the case of doctoral theses, examiners\nare encouraged to consider eight questions (quoted from the same website):\n\n1.4Guidelines for Examiners\n Does the candidate show sufficient familiarity with, and understanding and critical appraisal of, the relevant literature?\nDoes the thesis provide a sufficiently comprehensive investigation of the topic?Are the methods and techniques adopted appropriate \nto the subject matter and are they properly justified and applied? Are the results suitably set out and accompanied by adequate exposition and\ninterpretation? Are conclusions and implications appropriately developed and clearly linked to\nthe nature and content of the research framework and findings?Have the research questions in fact been tested? Is the literary quality \nand general presentation of the thesis of a suitably high\nstandard? Does the thesis as a whole constitute a substantive original contribution to\nknowledge in the subject area with which it deals?\nThese questions really are about the thesis rather than the candidate. They roughly\nparallel the structure of a solid thesis, and each builds on the previous one.\nThe first two questions are about familiarity with the previous work in your\nfield and the demonstration of a critical approach to it. Note that, from the start,\nhaving and demonstrating a critical attitude towards your subject sets the tone of\nyour interactions with the examiners.\nThe third question is about choosing appropriate research methods and justifying\nyour choices as appropriate to the topic. Be aware that it is you, at this point, who\nmust set the scope of that topic that will determine the appropriateness of a methodology. \nFurther, the third question alerts examiners to show concern for the manner\nin which the methods are applied.\nThe fourth question focuses on displaying the results, explaining them and\nshowing that you know what they mean. Here, then, it is not simply a question of\nshowing those in the discipline area what you have found but also that you know\nhow to present the results.\nThe fifth and sixth questions remind examiners to check the alignment, and connections, \nbetween an initial aim and the final conclusions. The logic flow in the\nthesis must be right. Notice, too, the emphasis on linking your interpretations back\nto what you said you would do earlier in the thesis.\nThe seventh question invites the reader to step away from the empirical side of\nthe study to consider how well you can write. In a sense, the question signals to both\nyou and the examiners just how important it is to be able to be able to communicate\nwell within the international research community.\nFinally, the eighth question asks examiners to consider the quality of the work\nas a whole. For doctoral students, producing work that is a ‘substantive original\ncontribution to knowledge’ is a primary goal that can be reached through writing\nsatisfactory responses to the series of previous questions.\nThere are other questions an examiner might also address. In particular, an examiner \nwould look for evidence of insightful or critical thinking, and of objective appraisal \nof outcomes of the study. That is, they want to be persuaded that the student\ncan think clearly and can construct a reasoned argument.\n\n1.5Types of Thesis\n This book focuses on PhD study, but there are several other forms of research work\nthat are understood to be theses. In the Australian context, the word ‘thesis’ is used\nto refer to the document that a student creates to earn a degree at the Honours, Masters, \nor doctoral level. (In other countries, such as the United States or Canada, the\nword ‘thesis’ is commonly used to signify work at the Honours or Masters degree\nlevel and ‘dissertation’ is generally used to refer to doctoral work.) What is the \ndifference between the different understandings of a thesis?\nAt Honours level, a thesis—strictly, a ‘minor thesis’—is a work of original\nresearch of approximately 10,000 words in length. For many students undertaking a\nminor thesis, it is the first time that they have conducted original research. From my\nexperience, one of the main struggles occurs in making the transition from ‘research\nconsumption’ to ‘research production’. Minor theses are closely supervised and, very\noften, stem from research that is of direct interest to the supervisor. An Honours thesis\nis typically produced within a year alongside the demands of coursework. For the\nmost part, they are assessed within the students’ department; note, therefore, that the\nreadership is well-known and thus the writing can be tailored to fit the audience.\nAt the Masters degree level, there are two types of theses. One is a minor thesis,\nwith length limits ranging from 10,000 to 25,000 words. It is completed within one\nor two years alongside coursework, and usually requires one or two semesters of\nfull-time effort. Much like those at the Honours level, minor theses are assessed\nwithin the department by a set of internal criteria.\nThe second type is a ‘Masters by research’ thesis of 30,000 to 40,000 words. It\nis much more substantial than those that are written by coursework students as it\nis the result of full-time research over one to two years. This thesis is examined by\nexperts in the field outside the department. In some departments, students first join\nthe field by writing a Masters thesis; if it is considered to be of high quality and can\nbe extended, it can be converted into a doctoral thesis.\nA ‘Doctor of Philosophy’ is earned by the successful completion of a PhD thesis.\nFor PhD students, the word limit of a thesis is 1,00,000 words; most students write\napproximately 80,000 words. In Australia, a PhD thesis is typically produced in\n3 years of full-time study. It is examined by two experts who have themselves supervised doctoral \nwork; and they are likely to be located at an international research\ninstitution.\nThere are other types of doctorate, too, including those in education, by exhibition (in fine arts), \nor by publication, but these are beyond the scope of this book. All\nof these should be described in the policies on your university’s website.\n\n1.6Look at Other Theses\n It’s now time to look at some other theses. Most supervisors have a few on their\nshelves that they may be willing to lend you. Reading these works will be a good\nstart, but don’t stop there. Probably they follow a pattern set by your supervisor’s\nown ideas of a good thesis, and almost certainly they will be typical of what your\nown department thinks is acceptable. So go out and look at theses from across a\nrange of disciplines, and even theses from other countries. As presentation and\nstyle change relatively rapidly, look at theses that are no more than 3 years old.\nIf applicable, examine a mix of kinds of studies, both qualitative and quantitative (see Chap. 8). \nTry and find work that is outside your field, but makes use\nof a similar methodology. After you have skimmed several, select some that are\ncoherent, and some that are not so clear, and go through a few of them with your\nsupervisor.\nRead the theses as if you were an examiner. With the guidelines for examiners\nin front of you, begin the assessment of each of them by first looking at the overall\nlayout. See if the table of contents gives you a clear idea of the structure of the work\nas a whole. Then browse the introduction and conclusions, and look through the reference section. Next, \nread the introduction carefully and compare it to the conclusions to see if the work is linked in a coherent manner (see the fifth question in the\nguidelines for examiners on page 3). It might surprise you to find that some theses\nfail to make this link. Look especially for specific formatting and conventions: How\nare particular words spelled? What is the best way to display data? What is the typical length of a chapter? \nYou may be impressed with the virtues of some theses, such\nas professional layouts, innovative displays of complex material in graphs or tables,\nor a strong integration of online materials. Stay alert for the points that impress you,\nand make a note to adopt them for your own work.\n\n1.7Examiners’ Reports\n Students are sometimes advised to track down examiners’ reports on submitted theses. For the most part, \nthe examination process is confidential, but make an effort\nto ask a completed student for a report or see if a supervisor is willing to share an\nexamination that is anonymous. As you read examiners’ reports, or the associated\nstudies on them, get in the frame of mind of these expert assessors. What do they\nlook for, and what do they ignore? Do they directly answer the suggested questions put forward by the university? These reports will be highly variable in detail\nand approach; What can you learn from these differences? Additionally, seek out\nacademic studies that concern thesis examination (search for the keywords: thesis\nquality, doctoral assessment, research training, PhD examination) with a view to\ndeveloping a better understanding of the assessment process. Feedback from examiners is summarized in the Appendix, \nwhich is a digest of observations from\nexaminers’ reports.\nI have examined numerous theses of each type: minor, Masters, and doctoral. In\neach case, my purpose is to assess the work with reference to the criteria at hand.\nMy considerations vary. At times I focus my comments on the big picture; at other\ntimes I hone in on details. My motivations for examination are not necessarily to\nhand out criticism, or even praise, but to sharpen a study. Academics examine theses\npartially out of service to the profession and partly as a favour to those who ask,\nbut mostly to learn something new before the work is presented at conferences or\npublished in journals. In short, as an examiner, I am looking to learn and, in this\nway, I’m just like the candidate.\nConsider the five potential outcomes of PhD examination at my university\n(edited slightly for clarity) that an examiner can choose from:\nBe awarded the degree of Doctor of Philosophy without further examination or\namendment.\nBe awarded the degree of Doctor of Philosophy without further examination,\nsubject to inserting in the thesis the minor corrections or additions as specified\nto the satisfaction of the Chair of Examiners, without further reference to the\nexaminer.\nBe awarded the degree of Doctor of Philosophy subject to revising part or parts\nof the thesis to the examiners’ satisfaction.\nNot yet be awarded the degree, but be permitted to resubmit the thesis in a revised form for re-examination. Areas requiring major amendment are identified\nin an examiners’ report.\nNot be awarded the degree of Doctor of Philosophy and not be permitted to submit for re-examination.\nThink for a moment of the implications of each of these outcomes. Remember, first\nof all, that there are two expert examiners who are assessing the work. If a student\nis awarded a PhD because both examiners have marked that it fits the first criteria,\nno more amendments are required. Nothing, not even occasional typos, requires\nchange: the only thing left to do is to make a bound, final copy to be archived at the\nuniversity, and perhaps submit an electronic copy to be placed online.\nMany students (including myself) earn the second mark. That is, they have been\nawarded the PhD, and no further examination is required, but there is a need to make\nsome corrections, write out a report to the Chair detailing the required changes, and\nreprint the thesis for submission. By awarding a PhD based on the third outcome,\nan examiner indicates that the student must revise entire sections. Substantial work\nis required, and the revised and reprinted thesis must be sent back to the examiner\nfor checking. The use of the fourth mark by an examiner indicates that the thesis\nrequires such major revisions that a PhD cannot yet be awarded, but the work can\nbe re-submitted. Finally, on occasion, examiners use the fifth outcome to deny both\nan award of a PhD and a chance to submit a revised thesis.\nExamination processes for minor theses are highly variable, with students being awarded pass/fail \nin some cases or a mark in others. Some processes allow for\nresubmission; some do not; examination may be within the department. In many\ninstitutions Masters theses are handled in the same way as PhDs, but in some places\ndifferent processes are used. Make sure that you are familiar with the mechanisms\nthat apply to your degree.\n\n1.8Summary of",

      "content": "Chapter 2\n2.1Thesis Structure\n Karen was undertaking a PhD in engineering to investigate whether a new type of\nplastic was safe to use as cookware. When she started her lab work, she decided\nto begin writing her thesis, but despite her determination she was having trouble. I\nknew Karen well, and she was a very good student who had been interested in new\nplastics ever since her undergraduate studies several years ago.\nKaren decided that the first thing to do was to write a review of the literature. I told\nher to send me an outline of how she expected to tackle it soon—but after two weeks\nnothing had yet appeared. I asked her what the problem was. ‘No problem’, she replied, \n‘I just have a lot more papers to read. When I’ve read and summarized them,\nthen I can start writing’. I reminded her that she’d told me a similar story a few weeks\nearlier: after reading a few more articles, she would indeed start writing. While reading those, \nhowever, she’d turned up several more. And then there was the material\nthat she had listed to read in the future. Karen then showed me several summaries,\nand each was separate. At that point, I concluded that she was never going to start.\nSeemingly, Karen had told herself that finding ‘a few more papers’ was the reason\nfor her continued delay, but from experience, I realized that her problem lay deeper.\n\n2.2Why We Have Trouble with New Tasks\n When we start a new project, figuring out how to proceed is easy if the project is\nsimilar to things we’ve done in the past. Building a bookcase, say, is not a big challenge \nfor someone who has already made a kitchen cupboard. But an entirely new\ntask is another matter: every aspect is unfamiliar, and it is not obvious how to begin\nor what the obstacles will be. We may not even know how to think about the problem. Imagine \nthe state of mind of someone whose practical experience is limited\nto building kitchen cupboards, but who is asked to build a three-bedroom house.\nThere will be many questions: Where to buy the materials? What materials? What\ntools are needed? Will the walls be strong enough? How to arrange for plumbers\nand plasterers? What is the first step? The task of starting to write a thesis may be\nequally as challenging.\nResearch is unpredictable. In nearly every project I’ve been connected with, the\nconclusions contained some unexpected elements. In most projects the aim of the\nwork changed as it progressed, sometimes several times. I’ve often—startlingly\noften!—had students say that their ‘experiments had failed’, but, when we had\nabsorbed the implications of the supposed failure, new hypotheses emerged that\nresulted in breakthroughs in their research. On several occasions truly surprising\nconclusions were staring the student (and me) in the face, yet we failed to see them\nfor weeks, or longer, because we were so hooked on what we expected to find. That\nis, continuing the analogy above, we may not even be sure of what kind of building\nwe are trying to construct.\nMoreover, the process of research is often not entirely rational. In the classical\napplication of the ‘scientific method’, the researcher is supposed to develop a hypothesis, then design a crucial experiment to test it. If the hypothesis withstands this\ntest a generalization is then argued for, and an advance in understanding has been\nmade. But where did the hypothesis come from in the first place? I have a colleague\nwhose favourite question is ‘Why is this so?’, and I’ve seen this innocent question\nspawn brilliant research projects on quite a few occasions. Research is a mixture\nof inspiration (hypothesis generation, musing over the odd and surprising, finding\nlines of attack on difficult problems) and rational thinking (design and execution\nof crucial experiments, analysis of results in terms of existing theory). Most of\nthe books on research methods and design of experiments—there are hundreds of\nthem—are concerned with the rational part, and fail to deal with the creative part,\nyet without the creative part no real research would be done, no new insights would\nbe gained, and no new theories would be formulated.\nA major part of producing a thesis is, of course, creating an account of the outcome\nof this rational–creative research process, and writing it is also a rational–creative\nprocess. However, the emphasis in the final product is far more on the rational side\nthan the creative side—we have to convince the examiners with our arguments. Yet\nall of us know that we do write creatively, at least in the fine detail of it. We talk of our\npens (or fingers on the keyboard) running ahead of our brains, as if our brains were\nthe rational part of us and our fingers were the creative part. We tend to separate one\nfrom the other. Of course this is nonsense, and we know it, yet the experience is there.\nWrestling with this problem has led me to the view that all writing, like all research, involves the tension between the creative and the rational parts of our brains.\nIt is this tension—as well as our lack of experience in the specific task of writing\ntheses—that makes it so hard for us to start writing, and sometimes gives us ‘writer’s block’. To get started, we must resolve the tension.\n\n2.3Structuring Your Thesis\n A colleague was concerned about the draft thesis that had been submitted to him\nby Henry, one of his students, and asked me to look at it. It was certainly difficult\nto know what was going on. Henry had written the draft straight from a logbook,\nexperiment after experiment, in chronological order:\nIn other words, Henry had presented a condensed diary, which certainly detailed the work he had undertaken but lacked the essential elements of a\nthesis: motivations for decisions made, interpretation and explanation, linking of\ndata to conclusions, and argument supporting propositions and hypotheses. Your\ntask as a writer is to document your processes, but equally to make these processes and the outcome of your work comprehensible to readers—not to explain how\nyou spent your time, or to describe the hypotheses that ultimately didn’t make\nsense. You need to structure your thesis in such a way that you take the reader\nfrom the aim to the conclusions, via the evidence and arguments, in the clearest\npossible way.\nAs noted, there is no such thing as a standard thesis, but a careful reading of the\nguidelines for examination does suggest that there is a standard thesis structure.\nIn essence, a thesis must first motivate the study, present background material and\nconduct a study. Results must be well argued and displayed, and the thesis has to\nend with a sound conclusion. My experience is that this standard structure works\nwell for theses in the physical, biomedical, mathematical, and social sciences. The\nnature of research in the humanities is different from that in the sciences, and different forms of reportage may be appropriate for theses in different areas.\n\n2.4The ‘Standard’ Thesis Structure\n The standard thesis structure has four parts: an introduction, the background, the\ncore (for want of a better word), and a synthesis. Note how, as illustrated in the\nfollowing figure, the sections are connected to each other. A conclusion responds\ndirectly to an aim, for example, and the background must directly foreshadow the\ncore.\nSome of these parts might contain more than one chapter, and the core might be\nmore than half the thesis. Each of these parts has a distinct role.\nThe introduction explains what the thesis is about: the problem that the thesis\nis concerned with, the aims and scope, and the thesis structure. In some disciplines\nit includes an overview of the findings. An introduction is typically written for a\nwider readership than the bulk of the thesis, and may use illustrative examples to\nhelp underpin the reader’s understanding of what you are trying to achieve. Such\nexamples help to create a narrative that a reader can use as context for your work.\nHowever, an introduction isn’t an essay—the only purpose it has is to introduce the\nresearch. You should outline the problem you have investigated, explain the aim of\nthe research and any limits on the scope of the work, and then provide an overview\nof what lies ahead. Five to ten pages is ample.\nThe background is the knowledge required before a reader can understand your\nresearch: relevant history, context, current knowledge, theory and practice, and\nother researchers’ views. In the background, your purpose is to position your study\nin the context of what has gone before, what is currently taking place, and how research in the area is conducted. It might contain a historical review. If the research is\nlocation-specific (an investigation of diet in low-income suburbs, for example, or an\nexamination of how a dialect is changing) you will need to describe the study area\nand its characteristics; if the research is technology-specific (such as a study of food\npackaging or the yield of a harvesting machine) you will need to describe the specifics of this technology and how it affects the questions you can ask. The background\nusually contains a chapter reviewing current theory or practice, and may include the\nresults of preliminary experiments or surveys carried out to help you feel your way\ninto the problem. Experiments may also be used to establish benchmarks based on\nother work against which your work is to be measured, and these too form part of\nthe background.\nThe core concerns your own work: your propositions or hypotheses, innovations, experimental designs, surveys and reviews, results, analysis, and so on.\n(This is sometimes called the contribution, though in a strong thesis the background too forms part of the contribution, as other researchers may value your\ninterpretation and analysis of past work as much as they value the ‘new’ work\npresented in the core.) The core can easily form the bulk of the thesis and consist\nof several chapters.\nThe synthesis draws together your contribution to the topic. It will usually contain a discussion in which you critically examine your own results in the light of the\nprevious state of the subject as outlined in the background, and make judgments as\nto what has been learnt in your work; the discussion may be a separate chapter, or\nmay be integrated with the detailed work in the core. Finally, it is where you summarise the discussion and evaluation to produce conclusions. These should respond\ndirectly to the aim of the work as stated in the introduction.\nThe structure of the core varies greatly from discipline. In one thesis, the first of\nthe chapters in the core might be a description of a survey tool and an explanation of\nhow it is linked to an investigation of why obese people make poor dietary choices;\nthe next might be a presentation and statistical analysis of the results; and the next\ntwo chapters a presentation of a detailed study of a small number of individuals,\nlooking at the impact of methods of changing their behaviour. In another thesis, the\nfirst core chapter might sketch why it is plausible that a particular food has an effect\non the immune system; the next might propose specific chemistry that would cause\nthis effect; the next might describe an experimental design to test for this chemistry;\nand so on.\nA common factor is that the core is a narrative leading from a proposition to an\noutcome, linked by evidence and argument. In a more complex thesis, there may\nbe a series of linked propositions, each independently supported by evidence and\nargument. I return to this issue in Chap. 7.\nBelow is a typical application of this structure, for a thesis examining the role\nof labels in diet choices. The thesis has three background chapters, which examine\ntwo aspects of labelling—legislative requirements and marketing—and social issues around food choices. These insights are used to develop a research survey for\nidentifying the level of understanding of and belief in labels, which in turn is used\nto propose and test the impact of alternative labelling mechanisms.\nThe Influence of Food Labelling on Young Adult Diet",

      "content": "Chapter 10 Conclusions\nThese four parts (introduction, background, core, and synthesis) are examined in\ndetail in Chaps. 5–10. My aim in this chapter is to convince you that you should\nensure that each of them is progressively developed as your writing proceeds. A\nstrong thesis is the product of considered work, where there has been opportunity to\ndebate, revise, and evaluate each chapter at leisure; and is particularly strong if the\ncomponents are tightly integrated. This integration is most easily achieved if they\nare written concurrently.\nHow many chapters should a PhD thesis have? If there are four main parts, each\ncontaining one to three chapters, we should not expect more than eight or ten chapters altogether. Many theses are accomplished in five to seven chapters. If you have\nmore, you should suspect that some are really only sections, and need to be consolidated. In some disciplines, theses are assembled by editing papers that the student\nhas published during the candidature to produce a coherent whole. With careless\nediting, such an approach can easily lead to a series of brief or fragmentary chapters\nthat don’t form a consistent and sustained argument; that is, the collection cannot\nin itself be considered a thesis. In far too many cases some of these chapters are\npreliminary work, or work that it is off-topic, that shouldn’t be included at all. My\nexperience is that producing a thesis in this way is usually much harder than the\nstudent expects—often the student feels that, since the papers were published, they\nare ‘finished’ and all that is required is to gather them together—whereas even an\nexperienced writer needs at least 5 or 6 months to turn a set of papers into an acceptable thesis.\nMy university once asked me to report on a request for financial assistance to\npublish a thesis as a book. It had around thirty chapters! The simple and coherent\nstructure discussed above was totally obscured by the proliferation of chapters with\nseemingly arbitrary titles. The effect was total fragmentation of the reasoning and\nimpact, and I was surprised that the examiners had passed it.\n\n2.5Narrative\n One way to think of the role of structure, and signposting, is as a kind of guide that\nwalks readers along a road from what they did know (past knowledge) to what they\nshould know (a knowledge frontier). When you write a thesis, it can be helpful to\nreflect on what you knew—and how you thought—when you began your work.\nThis earlier ‘you’ is the person you are writing for. The story, or narrative, that takes\nthe reader along the road should be as straightforward as you can make it. That is,\nyou may think to yourself: I have had to fumble, and explore, and make mistakes to\nget here, but I am now writing the guidebook that helps the next person to painlessly\ncome to the same point of view and the same knowledge.\nA key element to good writing is to clearly understand what the writing is meant\nto achieve. In my view, the twin concepts of narrative and audience—what you are\ntrying to say, and who you are saying it to—are the most important lessons a writer\ncan learn.\nLook for the structure behind the material you are describing, and don’t confuse\nnarrative with structure. The narrative concerns how you want the reader’s thoughts\nto develop as they read the thesis. The structure is how the material is organized to\ncreate a narrative. Different structures may be appropriate in different areas, particularly between \nthe humanities and (in the broadest sense) sciences. In an empirical study, the structure might be: the problem and its significance; relationship to\nprevious work; derivation of hypotheses; design of experiments; results; analysis\nand interpretations; conclusions (with, perhaps, two series of experiments, the second resting on the outcomes of the first). In contrast, in a literary study the structure\nmight be: the purpose of the study and its contribution to knowledge; evaluation of\nprevious studies; procedures, limitations, and assumptions; sources and documentation; analysis of facts and evaluation of evidence; conclusions. These structures are\nnot identical, but there are strong similarities.\nThere are other differences between theses. In some disciplines, it is the norm\nfor a thesis to be a consolidation of several papers; in others, the thesis is usually a\nsingle large piece of work. Some emphasize quantitative work, with, in the extreme,\na thesis where the contribution is mathematical theories or lab experiments that\nlead to precisely quantifiable outcomes; others emphasize qualitative work, with,\nfor example, discussion and argument based on documentary sources and other\nresearchers’ interpretations of records of events.\nSomething that all theses have in common is the need for analysis and reflective\nconsideration of the issues. Too often, researchers run the risk of merely describing\ntheir complex settings and ignore the need to demonstrate critical thinking.\n\n2.6Non-standard Thesis Structures\n Some theses do not fit into a standard structure. Across a wide range of disciplines\nthere is a trend towards a blending, for example, of quantitative and qualitative approaches. Such work might include, for example, an in-depth examination of the\ncontext and history of a situation before arriving at a ‘statement of the problem’.\nA quantitative survey might inform the development of interview questions, and\nthese in turn might lead to analyses of the results that may suggest yet another\nseries of questions. A series of chemical experiments may be inspired by a revisiting of a historical dispute, and be built on an analysis of arguments for competing\nmethodologies. A conceptual framework may be an outcome and not a starting\npoint.If you are writing a thesis that relies on a non-standard structure—or are writing\na thesis where the approach and problem might, in traditional terms, be ‘interdisciplinary’—don’t make the mistake of trying to reinvent the form of the thesis from\nscratch. Take the time to find other theses that have pursued similar problems in a\nsimilar way; read these theses, and others, to help yourself decide how your work\nshould be organized and presented. Make sure you are familiar with the methods of\nboth qualitative and quantitative research; there are many excellent books on these\ntopics, some written for specific disciplines but readable by a broad audience, such\nas the books on statistical research methods for psychology. And it is essential that\nyou establish a clear line of argument throughout your work.\nAs discussed in Chap. 1, be sure that you know the criteria for examination. Just\nbecause you are doing something ‘different’, you are not excused from creating a\nstrong academic argument that is underpinned by sound evidence, credible analysis,\nand clear writing.

When you write a thesis, it can be helpful to\nreflect on what you knew—and how you thought—when you began your work.\nThis earlier ‘you’ is the person you are writing for. The story, or narrative, that takes\nthe reader along the road should be as straightforward as you can make it. That is,\nyou may think to yourself: I have had to fumble, and explore, and make mistakes to\nget here, but I am now writing the guidebook that helps the next person to painlessly\ncome to the same point of view and the same knowledge.\nA key element to good writing is to clearly understand what the writing is meant\nto achieve. In my view, the twin concepts of narrative and audience—what you are\ntrying to say, and who you are saying it to—are the most important lessons a writer\ncan learn.\nLook for the structure behind the material you are describing, and don’t confuse\nnarrative with structure. The narrative concerns how you want the reader’s thoughts\nto develop as they read the thesis. The structure is how the material is organized to\ncreate a narrative. Different structures may be appropriate in different areas, particularly between \nthe humanities and (in the broadest sense) sciences. In an empirical study, the structure might be: the problem and its significance; relationship to\nprevious work; derivation of hypotheses; design of experiments; results; analysis\nand interpretations; conclusions (with, perhaps, two series of experiments, the second resting on the outcomes of the first). In contrast, in a literary study the structure\nmight be: the purpose of the study and its contribution to knowledge; evaluation of\nprevious studies; procedures, limitations, and assumptions; sources and documentation; analysis of facts and evaluation of evidence; conclusions. These structures are\nnot identical, but there are strong similarities.\nThere are other differences between theses. In some disciplines, it is the norm\nfor a thesis to be a consolidation of several papers; in others, the thesis is usually a\nsingle large piece of work. Some emphasize quantitative work, with, in the extreme,\na thesis where the contribution is mathematical theories or lab experiments that\nlead to precisely quantifiable outcomes; others emphasize qualitative work, with,\nfor example, discussion and argument based on documentary sources and other\nresearchers’ interpretations of records of events.\nSomething that all theses have in common is the need for analysis and reflective\nconsideration of the issues. Too often, researchers run the risk of merely describing\ntheir complex settings and ignore the need to demonstrate critical thinking.",

          "content": "2.62.6Non-standard Thesis Structures\n Some theses do not fit into a standard structure. Across a wide range of disciplines\nthere is a trend towards a blending, for example, of quantitative and qualitative approaches. Such work might include, for example, an in-depth examination of the\ncontext and history of a situation before arriving at a ‘statement of the problem’.\nA quantitative survey might inform the development of interview questions, and\nthese in turn might lead to analyses of the results that may suggest yet another\nseries of questions. A series of chemical experiments may be inspired by a revisiting of a historical dispute, and be built on an analysis of arguments for competing\nmethodologies. A conceptual framework may be an outcome and not a starting\npoint.If you are writing a thesis that relies on a non-standard structure—or are writing\na thesis where the approach and problem might, in traditional terms, be ‘interdisciplinary’—don’t make the mistake of trying to reinvent the form of the thesis from\nscratch. Take the time to find other theses that have pursued similar problems in a\nsimilar way; read these theses, and others, to help yourself decide how your work\nshould be organized and presented. Make sure you are familiar with the methods of\nboth qualitative and quantitative research; there are many excellent books on these\ntopics, some written for specific disciplines but readable by a broad audience, such\nas the books on statistical research methods for psychology. And it is essential that\nyou establish a clear line of argument throughout your work.\nAs discussed in Chap. 1, be sure that you know the criteria for examination. Just\nbecause you are doing something ‘different’, you are not excused from creating a\nstrong academic argument that is underpinned by sound evidence, credible analysis,\nand clear writing.

In this chapter, I take a brief detour and\nconsider some of the tools of writing and communication.\n\n3.2Writing at a Computer\n Most people do all their own typing and word processing—a dramatic change from\njust a decade or two ago, and nowadays the old approaches to thesis writing (which\nincluded use of professional typists and a great deal of writing by hand) are almost\nforgotten. All students are familiar with the challenges of using a word processor to\nproduce a well-written short work such as an essay. They are also familiar with the\nmodes of writing that computers encourage: frequent revision, writing of sections\nin any order (or of several sections at the same time), ease of change of style and\nlayout, and so on. The use of word processing has become universal, profoundly\naffecting the way research can be carried out and reported.\nHowever, the task of writing an extended document such as a thesis is a very\ndifferent process to that of writing a shorter work. Many students know the elementary features of word processors that are sufficient for a 3,000-word essay, but not\nthe more advanced features that help authors to maintain consistency of style and\npresentation over 50,000 words or more, a scale on which manual checking can\nbecome painfully laborious and where it is essential to have automatic maintenance\nof elements such as section and figure numbers. Likewise, good presentation requires software that automatically maintains bibliographies; mechanisms that create indexes and tables of contents; tools for professional-looking illustrations; and\nstrategies for keeping versions and back-ups.\nOn the other hand, some students tend to over-rely on some of the functions of\nword processors, such as grammar and spelling checkers, which may be designed\nfor general writing rather than the demands of communication within a specific academic community. Learning to make effective, appropriate use of a word processor\nis a key step towards timely completion of your thesis, and it is a mistake to assume\n\n3.3Mechanics of Writing\n that even long familiarity with a particular word processor means that you are using\nit well as a research tool (or that it is the right choice for your new activity).\nToday, the most widely used general-purpose word processor is Microsoft Word,\nor the OpenOffice equivalent; in the mathematical and physical sciences many researchers use the more technically oriented markup-based LaTeX. I do not explore\nthe specifics of these word processors, but encourage you to use resources such as\nadvanced guides and manuals to ensure that you are using them well—even an occasional revisit to an online tutorial can be surprisingly rewarding.\nA typical word processor can be viewed as a suite of separate tools, perhaps\nbundled together under a common user interface. These tools might include an editor, for entering and modifying text; spelling and grammar checkers; a bibliography\ndatabase; a line-art environment; and a system for laying out the text in a form suitable for printing or for viewing online. This last point is particularly important: a\nword processor allows the style of a document to be separated from its content, and\nthe two issues are important at different stages of the thesis creation process.\n\n3.4Presentation\n The fine details of the style of your thesis may not become settled until it is almost\nfinished, and I strongly encourage that, in the early stages at least, your focus is on\ncreation of content rather than on how it appears on the page. Nonetheless, right from\nthe start you need to write within the constraints of a style—for example, so that all\nheadings of the same kind, such as chapter titles, are displayed in the same way.\nWhich format do you adopt? In principle, you have great latitude in your choices,\nso long as you are consistent in what you do. In practice, however, you should adopt\na thesis style that is already in use in your department, and it may well be that your\nsupervisor has specific requirements. You should also be aware of field-specific\nguidelines, such as those published by the American Psychological Association.\nThat said, some standard styles are less than eye-pleasing, and you may want to refine the appearance. The key thing is that you use a style from the start, so that you\ncan easily change the appearance of the whole thesis if you want to do so.\nPay particular attention to the way you cite references, both in-text and in the\nbibliography or reference section of your thesis. Your professional handling of references is one way that examiners assess your readiness to enter the community\nof scholars. If you are sloppy, or maintain incomplete lists, or perhaps fail to cite a\nwork, it signals that are you not respecting colleagues. Quite apart from the inherent importance of this, you will annoy an examiner if you cite material and fail to\nlist it. One way an examiner checks to see whether you know what you are talking\nabout is to check the references as you cite them. Conversely, you shouldn’t put\nreferences in your list of references unless you have cited them. So all of these have\nto be checked, one by one. Read your own text the way that the examiner would,\nchecking the list every time you come to a citation. My advice is to be systematic\nwhen you are collecting the reference material in the first place, and remain aware\nof the importance of correct citations throughout your professional career.\nUsing a style means that, once you have established a pattern, you can easily\nstick to it and the reader will get the same message every time. For example, main\nsection headings, wherever they appear in your document, will always be in the\nsame typeface (font) and of the same size. They should always be preceded by the\nsame space separation from preceding text, and always be followed by the same\nspace separation. If the style you choose is clearly different from that of other headings, the reader will quickly understand ‘We are starting a new main section’ or\n‘This is a sub-section within the section’. This is especially true if you use a style\nthat is familiar to most readers in the field.\nA thesis consists of several different parts that need to be tied together with a set\nof conventions. Without a standard format across the entire document, the work will\nappear random and unprofessional. For example, you should put all chapter headings on a new page, using the same style; that is, the same font and paragraphing.\nYou should give all major section headings a style that is different from that of the\nchapter headings. Captions to figures should all have the same style, but be different\nagain from section headings and different from the main text. All new paragraphs\nshould begin with the same indentation (except for the first paragraph after a heading, which may have no indent at all), and so on. All this will help your readers to\nnavigate their way through your thesis. This styling is provided with templates,\nwhich govern the appearance and numbering of every element of a document.\nBefore you start writing your report or thesis, you should think about its format\nand devise styles and formatting rules that are appropriate for your field of study.\nBegin as you mean to continue. Introduce rules as necessary, and be aware that too\nmuch complexity can work against you. For example, avoid deep structures—is it\nreally necessary to have paragraphs with numbers like 3.1.2.1a(iii)? Once you have\na style, any element of the document can be put in that format, and you are on your\nway to producing a professional-looking thesis. While you may have had little previous exposure to creation or use of styles, in my view templates are the single most\nimportant feature of a word processor, and you must learn how to use them properly.\nAfter creating a style, you can generate a thesis structure, with a few empty\nchapters and perhaps some subheadings and so on. You can then use the style to\ngenerate a table of contents, and begin to get a sense of how the final thesis will appear. As you proceed, you will use the table of contents, or other outline tools, to get\na sense of the current structure of the thesis and where it may need revision—extra\nchapters, moving of material from one section to the next, changing how headings\nrelate to each other in the hierarchy, and so on.\n\n3.5Writing Tools\n Most word-processing programs include a facility for checking spelling. It checks\nevery word you have typed against a dictionary built into the program. Do not ignore it!1\nFew people are infallible spellers or proofreaders and it is only rational to\nIt’s been argued that spell-checkers make authors lazy, and that writers at any level with access to\na spell-checker make more mistakes than those without. I suspect that this is a case where average\nhave oddities questioned. However, although the spell-check is good at picking up\ntypographical errors, it can’t make decisions for you. Typical problems are proper\nnames (people’s names or place names), and words for which there are alternative spellings. In the case of proper names, the temptation is to tell the program to\nignore its questionings, and go instead to the next area of doubt. This is a mistake:\nyou should check any proper name the first time the spell-check comes to it and,\nwhen you are satisfied that you have got it right, add it to the dictionary. The second\nproblem is words for which alternative spellings are permissible ( -or or -our and\n-ize or -ise are the most common). The most important constraint here is that you\nbe consistent. Before you start, determine your preferred spellings for these words,\nand keep to them.On a related note, don’t rely on the spell-check to proofread for you; although it\nwill pick up misspelt words, it won’t distinguish between, for example, there and\ntheir, or affect and effect. Similarly, it won’t tell you if you have left a word out.\nGrammar-checkers look at every sentence, and make checks such as: Does it\ncontain a verb?; Is it missing connecting words?; Does the subject agree with the\nverb (plural subjects must not have singular verbs)?; Is the verb in the passive voice\n(permissible, but should be used sparingly)?; Are stock phrases being used (examples: ‘over and above’; ‘in order to’, ‘part and parcel’)?; and so on. You may think\nthat your English is better than that of the grammar checker—and some of the time\nyou will be right—but my experience is that they are often useful, and it is essential\nto use a grammar-checker at least once before finalizing your thesis.\n\n3.6References\n The name and year (or Harvard) system is the most popular reference style for\ntheses. It works well for readers, because it names references in an understandable\nway, and also works grammatically. We can write for example ‘Rami and Tuntara\n(2002) found little evidence of …’ or ‘… there was little evidence (Rami and Tuntara 2002)’. There are many alternatives, but the Harvard style is simple and effective.\nAnother form of referencing is the numbered note, or footnote, system, which is\nused in many books. Such notes are usually collected at the end of each page. When\nthe page is printed out you will see the superscript number in the main text and the\nfootnote text at the bottom of the page, separated from the main text by a dividing\nline. If you have more than one reference number on the page, the footnotes are all\ncollected automatically on that page, or instead the notes can be collected at the end\nof a chapter or in a consolidated listing at the end of your thesis. Note that tools\nfor maintenance of references provide mechanisms for changing from one style to\nbehaviour is meaningless—for some people it is an essential tool, while for others it is little more\nthan a distraction. However, spell-checkers are at best a partial solution, and do not allow an author\nto avoid the task of a thorough proofread.",
