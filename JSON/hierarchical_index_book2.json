This goal guided the creation of\nour World’s Healthiest Foods website (www.WHFoods.org) and The\nWorld’s Healthiest Foods book.\nDuring the past 10 years, I have been delighted to receive thousands\nof letters of gratitude from Readers, who have taken the time to\nshare with me how eating the World’s Healthiest Foods has changed\ntheir lives. They have written to tell me that they have experienced\ngreater energy, better sleep, more lustrous hair, clearer skin, enhanced\nconcentration and memory, and many other signs of overall vitality.\nOthers have also shared that eating the World’s Healthiest Foods has\nhelped their cholesterol to drop, their blood pressure to normalize,\ntheir blood sugar levels to stabilize, and their headaches to dissipate.\nOver the years, Readers have shared with me how much they have\nlearned from the WHFoods website and The World’s Healthiest\nFoods book. Yet, this learning is definitely a two-way street: as\nReaders have learned from us, we have also learned so much from\nthem. One of the discoveries that I find most exciting has been the\nrecognition of yet another incredibly positive benefit of the World’s\nHealthiest Foods:\nEnjoying the World's Healthiest Foods is the perfect way to\nlose excess weight and maintain a healthful weight without\ndieting.Here are just a few of the inspiring stories I’ve received from\nReaders telling me about their experiences:\nOne benefit I've discovered from eating high-fiber, nutrient-rich\nWorld's Healthiest Foods is that I'm losing about 2 pounds per week\nwithout any change in my exercise habits. I don't feel deprived\nbecause I don't consider myself to be \"on a diet.\" Thank you again\nfor your outstanding website. Eating the right foods has changed\nmy entire outlook on life. - Mike\nThe two weeks we have been on your program has proved not only\nto be nutritious but extremely tasty. Members of my household are\nfor the first time eating fish and not complaining. My partner has\nlost half a stone in two weeks so would just like to say a very big\nthank you. - Lara\nThe World’s Healthiest Foods are possibly the cure to the American\nproblem of obesity. From my own experience, I decided to change\nmy way of eating in the New Year. I was obese—at 5’8.” I was 240\npounds. Now six months later, I have lost 32 pounds and am still\nlosing. I feel and look a lot better. - Astrida\nBecause of your great website, WHFoods, you have helped change\nmy health for the better. I went from 24% body fat to 13% body fat.\nThanks again for your generous knowledge. - GVU\nThrough diet and exercise I lost 170 pounds. I have your list of the\nWorld's Healthiest Foods on my refrigerator. - Mark \n\n1.2Healthy Weight Loss and Improved Health\n While excess weight in and of itself may be cosmetically undesirable,its most serious harmful effects result from the fact that excess fat,\nparticularly around the mid-section, greatly increases risk of developing\na myriad of other health conditions, including high cholesterol, high\nblood pressure, and elevated blood sugar levels. Many Readers have reported that eating World’s Healthiest Foods not only helped them lose\nweight, but also alleviated weight-related health problems as well:\nBy using some of the guides, recipes, and tips from WHFoods, I've\nlost 40 pounds. I feel better and my thinking is more clear. I had\nhigh blood pressure but that went away when I lost the weight.\n- Kmuzu\nSince I started eating the World’s Healthiest Foods, my blood sugar\nhas stabilized, and I have lost 50 pounds! I have truly turned my\nlife around. - Cindy\nI changed the way I ate, and I have the World's Healthiest Foods to\nthank. I have lost over 75 pounds. My blood pressure medication is\ngone. I didn't count calories and I didn’t even care about portion\ncontrol. - Mary\nWith your help, I have lost 80 pounds; my cholesterol was 280 and\nis now down to 170! - KC\nThank you so very much for your food information. I have been\nreligiously following your advice for about two years. I've lost 100\npounds. You literally don't have time to read my long litany of health\nimprovements, but they range from dramatically improved mood to\namazing night vision. - BI \n\n1.3Healthy Weight Loss and Increased Energy Levels\n Many readers commented that the key to losing weight was forgetting\nabout counting calories and focusing instead on eating more of the\nWorld's Healthiest Foods. Readers told us that these foods not only\nhelped them feel more vibrant and energetic, but they successfully\nlost weight without feeling deprived or sacrificing anything—including enjoyment—in the process:\nI’ve been researching and preparing meals based on WHFoods.org\nfor the past month. I feel far more alive, alert, enlightened, and\nenergized. I now experience greater degrees of balance, equilibrium,\nand sound sleep and no more mood swings. - Michelle\nI have lost weight while I eat more. I have also found more energy\nand strength. And for that reason, I wish to thank you very much.\nMitch\nIt has been nearly six months since I began changing over to the\nWorld's Healthiest Foods, and I am pleasantly surprised at my increase in energy, the loss of dress sizes, and the overall feeling of\ngood health. I find that my refrigerator is not filled with \"empty\ncalories\" and that I can always have great snacks and healthy delicious food to eat. - Terri\nThank you!!! I just needed to thank you for changing my life. This\ninformation has created a better, healthier, and more energetic me.\nI have lost close to 30 pounds by changing my way of eating. I was\na terrible fast-food, processed-food eater, never drank water or ate\nany kind of fruit; now I think I would die without those things. Just\nthe thought of fast foods makes me sick. I just couldn't let this\nchange in my life go without thanking you so much for helping me.\nDL\n\n1.4Healthy Weight Loss and the Healthiest Way of Cooking\n I have spent years developing cooking methods and recipes to make\nthe World's Healthiest Foods taste great because no matter how\nnutritious your food, you won't enjoy it, and won’t keep eating it, if\nit doesn't taste good. Readers have written us about how much they\nlove our easy-to-prepare recipes using our Healthiest Way of Cooking\nmethods:\nI started using the Healthy Sauté method of preparing food. I am a\n65-year-old male who now weighs 172 pounds. I began at 245\npounds. I only use fresh veggies, fruits, etc. and the Healthy Sauté\nmethod for cooking. I do grill and eat meat/fish in moderation. I\nwant to thank you so much for changing my life. I have maintained\nmy current weight for 6 months and increased my exercise regimen\nfrom swimming to a full gym program. Food now is so important to\nme because you have been there to help people like me. Keep up the\ngood work. I love the recipes. I have discovered so much. - DD\nWith your assistance I have lost 17 pounds, which previously\nseemed impossible. Your recipes taste so good—easy and fast, which\nis what we all need. I have purchased your book for my mother sister and two friends. I share your daily recipes with my co-workers\nwho also want your book. Thanks so much for providing all of us so\nmuch help. - Cheryl\nI bought George's book, The World's Healthiest Foods, in January\nand began to look at how I ate, what I ate, how much I ate. After less\nthan four months, I found my weight down almost 20 pounds; my\nhusband (who had not meant to go on a diet, but whose cook is,\nyes, me) had lost seven pounds as well. My energy level has increased\nas well, and the level of fruit and veggie intake has increased\ndramatically. Salads became an adventure, and the use of nuts and\nspices added zest to the foods. - Ann\nYour Plan meets all of my requirements for becoming healthy: simple\nprep time, quick and easy cooking methods, and gourmet tasting\nmeals every time! I've lost over thirty pounds in three and one-half\nmonths. I have more energy than I can use, and better skin than I\never would have thought possible. The World's Healthiest Foods are\ntruly the best guide for those of us who want to pursue health while\nhaving time to enjoy life outside of the kitchen. - Rosemary\nI am loving this site, and my interest in whole foods and preparing\n(with your methods of course) my meals has never been like this.\nBI\nThe style of cooking you have perfected makes food preparation so\neasy and the outcome so richly flavorful. - Marie\n\n1.5What is the Secret of Healthy Weight Loss?\n So, by now you must be wondering, “What is it about the World’s\nHealthiest Foods that made them so effective in producing healthy\nlasting weight loss, vibrant health, and energy for the Readers who\nshared their success stories?”\nIt’s simple, actually. The World’s Healthiest Foods are nutrient-rich\nfoods. I believe that this is the secret of why the Readers were losing\nweight –the wide range and quantity of nutrients these foods deliver\nfor the small amount of calories that they contain (what I refer to as\n“nutrient-richness”).\nNutrient-Rich World’s Healthiest Foods = Maximum Nutrients\nMinimal Calories\nThe classification of a food as nutrient-rich reflects its ability to\nprovide a wealth of nutrients (vitamins, minerals, phytonutrients,\nantioxidants, fiber, protein, omega-3 fatty acids, and other health promoting compounds) for a minimal amount of calories. In sharp\ncontrast, nutrient-poor foods are ones that provide a small number\nof nutrients, but a large number of calories; these include processed,\nrefined, and fast foods.\nSo by enjoying their meals composed of nutrient-rich World's\nHealthiest Foods, it was much easier for Readers to get all of the\nnutrients their bodies required for vital health and energy without\nexceeding the amount of calories that their bodies needed to maintain\noptimal weight. And, at the same time, they were satisfying their\nappetite and taste buds. For this reason, when they relied on the\nWorld’s Healthiest Foods, they lost weight naturally, effortlessly,\nand surprisingly quickly—a winning combination. These foods are\nnutritional bargains; they provide an abundance of health-promoting\nnutrients without a lot of calories.\nThe World’s Healthiest Foods are whole foods that contain all of the\nnutrients that nature provides to ensure the health and life of plants\nand animals. When we eat nutrient-rich World's Healthiest Foods,\nespecially when they are organically grown, we enjoy the protective\nqualities nature has supplied; nothing is contained in these foods\nthat doesn’t need to be there. Because the World’s Healthiest Foods\nprovide what is essential and leave out what it unnecessary, they are\ncustom-tailored for weight management. And the more you eat them,\nthe better they will taste. Nutrient-rich World's Healthiest Foods are\nthe new force for change—they can make a healthier and slimmer you. \n\n1.6Why the Nutrient-Rich World’s Healthiest Foods Promote Healthy Weight Loss\n What is it about nutrient-richness that helps promote weight loss?\nSeveral factors are involved. Nutrient-rich foods provide our body\nwith outstanding nutrient support that enables our body to carry out\nits metabolic activities in an optimal way. Metabolic activities, such\nas the burning of unwanted fat (a process called beta-oxidation), are\nbest supported by a diet that is rich in nutrients.Nutrient-richness also means that we provide our body with ample\nnutrients at a minimal calorie cost. (Many researchers use the term\n“nutrient density” to describe this special dietary combination of\nhigh-nutrients plus low-calories.) It’s helpful to think about nutrientrichness by comparing it to its dietary opposite. Imagine a person\nwhose diet is largely composed of nutrient-poor highly processed\nfatty foods and fast food, i.e, extremely low-quality food containing\nvery few nutrients. If that person consumes enough food, he or she\nwill eventually obtain a supply of some nutrients; however, many\nvitamins and minerals necessary for a healthy metabolism—as well\nas most recently discovered antioxidants and phytonutrients abundant\nin plant foods that research is now showing to play important roles\nin maintaining a healthy weight—will be virtually absent.\nIn addition, how many calories of low nutrient-density food will it\ntake to get even some nutrient basics? With very low-quality foods,\nif a person eats somewhere around 6,000 or 7,000 calories’ worth of\nfood, he or she will probably get an adequate supply of basic nutrients.\nBut the caloric cost will be far too high. Body fat and weight gain\nwill increase from excessive calorie consumption.\nIn contrast, the use of low-calorie foods to increase food volume\nand the use of nutrient-rich World’s Healthiest Foods to support\nmetabolism are core research principles in the science of weight\nloss. When your weight loss strategy centers around low-calorie and\nnutrient-rich World’s Healthiest Foods, the research odds are\nstrongly in your favor for weight loss success. And this is not difficult\nto do; in fact, I will show you how to get most of the nutrients you\nneed in the Healthy Weight Loss Eating Plan (page 91) and spend\nless than 1600 calories. \n\n1.7New Paradigm in Weight Loss\n Most weight loss plans require you to follow some new type of diet\nfor the first time in your life. These weight loss plans depend upon\na certain amount of novelty. They are betting that you’ve never eaten\nthis way before (and chances are, you will never eat this way\nagain!). They are also assuming that you aren’t familiar with the\n“special twists” in their theory of weight loss. They give you a diet\nthat includes these special twists in the hope that you’ll find it new\nand interesting enough to make you willing to put up with whatever\nunbalanced regimen is prescribed through a period of initial weight\nloss. Then you get bored, go back to the way of eating that put on\nthose pounds in the first place, and gain it all back – just in time for\nthe next weight loss novelty book to hit the market. As I present in\nthis book, the World’s Healthiest Foods as the key to Healthy Weight\nLoss is different.\nThe World's Healthiest Foods aren’t part of a diet relying on some\nnew gimmick to be followed on a temporary basis. These foods are\npart of the everyday eating habits that will make you lean and\nhealthy. Our focus is a package of nutrient-rich World’s Healthiest\nFoods and very quick-and-easy recipes and menu suggestions. The\nbasis of Healthy Weight Loss –Without Dieting is simply enjoying a\ncornucopia of World’s Healthiest Foods prepared using the Healthiest\nWay of Cooking Methods, which enhance flavor while preserving\nnutrients. It’s not a diet; it’s a way of eating that serves up a delicious,\npotently healthy way of life.\nOur new paradigm parts company with the catchy fad diets that ask\nyou to follow unusual food rules or dietary restrictions. Our new\nparadigm insists that the “tried-and-true” principles of healthy eating\ncan be followed at all times in life, including those times when you\nmost desperately want to lose weight! These basic rules include a focus on:\nNutrient-rich foods like the World’s Healthiest Foods that give you the largest number of nutrients for the smallest\nnumber of calories.Simple, quick, cooking practices that preserve as much of\na food’s natural constituents as possible.And, just as important, that magical kind of pleasure that\ncomes from the delicious tastes and textures of real food.",

      "content": "Chapter 2 \n2.1Why Nutrient-Richness Can Help You Lose Weight\n Readers wrote to tell me that when they shifted their meals to include\nmore of the World’s Healthiest Foods, they not only experienced\nenhanced health, but—without even trying—those who wanted to\nlose weight found that they were readily doing so. The research we\ndid helped us to more clearly understand why Readers lost weight\nand why the World’s Healthiest Foods were so effective in weight\nloss.\nAnd now let me explain why it can work for you. The reason these\nfoods are so beneficial is that they are concentrated sources of a vast\narray of health-promoting nutrients. Nutrient-richness is the term I\nuse to describe this remarkable feature of the World’s Healthiest\nFoods. I want to explain more about the benefits of this key criterion\nof the World’s Healthiest Foods, so you can fully understand why\nit’s so important.\nNutrient-richness is a measurement of the concentration of nutrients\na food can deliver in exchange for the amount of calories it contains.\nOn the World’s Healthiest Foods website (www.WHFoods.org) and\nin my book, The World’s Healthiest Foods, nutrient-richness is\nshown both qualitatively (a food may be defined as a good, very\ngood, or excellent source of a particular nutrient) and quantitatively\n(the numerical scores that a food achieves in association with each\nparticular nutrient).\nSince we only have a limited amount of calories that we can consume\nif we want to lose weight or maintain our weight while simultaneously\ntaking in a sufficient range and amount of nutrients to maintain our\nhealth, it is essential for us to get as many nutrients as possible in comparison to the number \nof calories we consume. Fortunately, it’s easy to do this by focusing on the nutrient-rich World’s Healthiest Foods.\nThe latest scientific research clearly shows that successful weight\nloss requires that we eat nutrient-rich foods. In large, nationwide\nstudies that have included both healthy-weight and overweight\nparticipants, insufficient intake of vitamins and minerals has been\nconsistently linked to higher body weights. Eating few fresh\nvegetables and fruits leads not only to inadequate nourishment, but\nhas also been linked to weight problems. In studies of overweight\nchildren attempting to lose weight, increased consumption of nutrientrich vegetables has also been associated with better weight loss\nsuccess.\nNew evidence associates diets high in salads, vegetables, and fruits\nand low in processed and refined foods with healthy weight because\nthey contain phytonutrients—beneficial compounds found exclusively\nin fruits and vegetables that possess the power to help keep us\nhealthy and help the body maintain an optimal, healthy weight. Also\nsalads, vegetables, and fruits are rich in antioxidants, which we need\nif we want to lose weight. Studies show that overweight individuals\nhave higher levels of oxidative stress from an excess of free radicals\nand lack of antioxidants. \n\n2.2The Nutrients We Need Each Day\n Each day, we need hundreds of nutrients to stay healthy, and these\nnutrients must be supplied by the food we eat.\nThe following chart will give you a sense of the variety of some of\nthe nutrients we must get each day from our food if we wish to\nexperience a healthy weight and optimal health. Please note that this\nchart is by no means comprehensive; it doesn’t show you all of the\nnutrients you need.\nFor example, phytonutrients—plant nutrients such as carotenoids\n(beta carotene, lutein, zeaxanthan) and flavonoids (anthocyanins,\ncatechins, quercetin)—are now known to be essential to health, but\nwhile researchers have identified approximately 10,000 phytonutrients, they estimate at least 40,000 phyonutrients may eventually\nbe catalogued.\nEven though they have yet to be named or identified in the laboratory, these phytonutrients are still very much present—in nutrientrich foods, like the World’s Healthiest Foods. In fact, that is the only\nplace you can currently get them! They cannot, for example, be\nobtained from dietary supplements because they have not yet been\nisolated from the whole, natural foods that contain them. Nor are\nthey available in highly processed “fast” foods.\nThe following chart contains some well-established and wellresearched nutrients that are included in the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration’s “Reference Values for Nutrition Labeling.” Next\nto each nutrient you’ll see the Daily Value (DV) that was established\nas part of the FDA’s labeling program. Please note that this DV value\nis a population-based goal and may not reflect the exact amount of\nthe nutrient that would be best for you (for this information you should\nseek the advice of a nutrition-oriented healthcare practitioner). Yet,\nthese Daily Values can give you a sense of general nutrient intake\ngoals and emphasize how nutrient-rich World’s Healthiest Foods can\nprovide you with outstanding benefits in terms of Daily Values. \n\n2.3Fresh Fruits, Salads, and Vegetables are Among the Most Nutrient-Rich Foods\n It’s clear that nutrient-richness is a key to maintaining health and\nlosing weight healthfully. And what are among the most nutrientrich foods that people can easily incorporate into their Healthiest\nWay of Eating to help them boost their well-being? Fresh fruits,\nsalads, and vegetables.\nYet, which foods do most of us not eat enough of? Fresh fruits, salads,\nand vegetables.\nIn fact, 80% of Americans are compromising their ability to maintain\na healthy weight and endangering their health by failing to eat\nenough fresh fruits, salads, and vegetables. I find this to be of great\nconcern. It’s quite straightforward: the more fruits, salads, and\nvegetables, the easier it will be for you to get the nutrients you\nneed for optimal health at a “caloric cost” so low that you will\neasily lose excess weight. I strongly believe that Americans’ seeming\naversion to whole fruits, salads, and vegetables is one of the major\ncauses of the obesity epidemic in this country (and, in the Healthy Weight Loss Eating Plan, I will show you how to make these foods\ntaste good so that you will truly enjoy them).\nMy approach to healthy weight loss emphasizes fresh fruits, salads,\nand vegetables—the lowest calorie food group available on the\nplanet. On the WHFoods.org website and The World’s Healthiest\nFoods book, we profile more than two dozen low-calorie vegetables\nand over twenty fruits. With easy-to-prepare recipes and menus—\nwhich rely on low-calorie, deliciously prepared fresh fruits, salads,\nand vegetables—I will help you to have 5-9 recommended servings\nevery day. Based on the weight loss research, these foods are your\nbest option for increasing food volume and enjoying tasty, satisfying\nmeals while keeping your overall calories low. \n\n2.4Nutrient-Rich Food Illustrations\n Spinach\nTo further explain the unique qualities of nutrient-rich World’s\nHealthiest Foods, and to clearly illustrate how important they are to\nhealth and healthy weight loss, I want to share with you some food\ncomparisons. Following is a chart showing the contributions of\nnutrients, including the % Daily Value (DV) of 22 nutrients of which\nspinach is an especially concentrated source.One cup cooked spinach 41 calories\nNutrient %DV\nVitamin K 1111\nVitamin A 377\nManganese 84\nFolate 66\nMagnesium 39\nIron 36\nVitamin C 29\nVitamin B2 (Riboflavin) 25\nCalcium 25\nPotassium 24\nVitamin B6 (Pyridoxine) 22\nTryptophan 22\nVitamin E 19\nDietary Fiber 17\nCopper 16\nVitamin B1 (Thiamin) 11\nProtein 11\nPhosphorus 10\nZinc 9\nOmega-3 Fatty Acids 6\nVitamin B3 (Niacin) 4\nSelenium 4 \nAs you can see, one cup of cooked spinach contains only 41 calories.\nThat’s 2.3% of the calories that would be included in a 1,800-calorie\ndiet. Yet, for just over 2% of your daily calories, you get between 10%\nand 100% of the Daily Value for 16 nutrients! In addition to these\nremarkable benefits for these nutrients, this one-cup serving of\nspinach lets you exceed (by leaps and bounds) your daily intake goals\nfor vitamin K (1111%) and pro-vitamin A (295%). All of these\namazing benefits and you still have about 1,760 calories left to enjoy and “use” to get more nutrients! That’s almost 98% of your day’s\ncalories left to enjoy after meeting such important nutritional goals on\nyour path to vibrant health, increased energy, and healthy weight loss.",

You’ll see how they provide so many great benefits and are\ntherefore the key to healthy weight loss and optimal health.\nEven though most everyone is familiar with the idea of nutrition and\nnutrients, many people do not really know what nutrients actually do\nand how they work, including how they contribute to weight loss. I\nwant to tell you what nutrients do by starting out with the simple\nexample of calcium.\nYou’ve no doubt heard that calcium is important for the health of\nyour bones. And you may also have heard that osteoporosis—a bone\nproblem that affects 20 million adults in the U.S.—can be “prevented\nby calcium.”\nI wish things were this simple! But unfortunately, they are not. Even\nthough calcium plays a pivotal role in maintaining our bone health,\nit’s just not true that calcium, all by itself, can prevent the occurrence of osteoporosis.\nFirst of all, there are many more nutrients that bones need to build\ntheir structure and density. For example, for good bone health you need magnesium, manganese, zinc, vitamin D, vitamin C, vitamin K,\nboron, silicon, potassium, and a variety of other nutrients. Just\nfocusing on calcium won’t allow you to achieve the goal of good bone\nhealth. You need a much broader list of nutrients that can only be provided by nutrient-rich foods like the World’s Healthiest Foods.\nMost people are used to thinking about nutrients in a “this cures\nthat” type of way. This way of thinking is sometimes encouraged\nby the overly simplified positioning of dietary supplements in the\nmarketplace. Manufacturers often include health claims on their\nproduct labels that present relatively simple cause-effect relationships\nbetween nutrients and health. For example, a supplement manufacturer might claim that calcium builds strong bones, or that fiber\nmaintains bowel regularity, or that vitamin E supports heart health.\nWhile all of these connections between nutrients and health have\nscience-based validity, consumers might end up concluding that all\nthey need for a healthy heart is vitamin E, or that nothing more is\nneeded for building strong bones than calcium. The truth of the\nmatter is that no single nutrient is a magic bullet that can singlehandedly prevent a disease or protect an entire body system like\nblood vessels or bones.\nIt’s not as if a nutrient waves a magic want and voila…a health\nproblem is fixed. The reason that nutrients are related to the\nprevention of future health problems and the improvement of existing\nones is connected to the role that nutrients play in all of the body’s\nunderlying structures and metabolic activities. They are the resources\nthat our body needs to make and maintain healthy cells. They are the\nsubstances that help run our metabolism and allow our body to go\nabout its moment-by-moment physiologic activities. Without them,\nour body cannot do the things it needs to do: for example, our cells\ncan’t communicate, our muscles can’t contract, and oxygen can’t\nbe carried in our blood. Those three activities are joined by literally\nthousands of other activities that go on every second at a metabolic\nlevel that is invisible to us but absolutely critical to our health.\nNutrients, therefore, are the ingredients in the body’s recipe for supporting its underlying structure and function, which serve as the\nfoundation for our physical health.\nYou can get a glimpse of this massive underlying health foundation\nif you take any single nutrient and look at everything it does in the\nbody. As an example, let’s take magnesium.\nMagnesium is a co-factor in over 300 different enzymatic reactions.\nThese include many steps in the energy production cycle as well as\nthe synthesis of our DNA. Magnesium is also an important component\nin bone structure and plays an important role in cell-to-cell communication, especially that involving our nerve and muscle cells.\nWithout adequate amounts of magnesium, our bodies wouldn’t be\nable to function properly, which can first lead to lowered energy and\nthen potentially progress to a variety of different signs, symptoms,\nand health conditions when things aren’t working well. As you can\nalso see, it’s more complicated than simply saying that the role of\nmagnesium is to promote heart health or bone health, two claims\nthat are often associated with this mineral. Magnesium, like all other\nnutrients, is needed in hundreds of different ways for support of our\nunderlying metabolic processes, and it is these underlying processes\nthat serve as the true foundation for our overall physical health.\nYou might think that this more comprehensive and holistic view of\nhealth and nutrients would make nourishment more complicated.\nBut it’s actually the opposite! The true role of nutrients in your\nhealth actually makes things much simpler.\nThat’s because the World’s Healthiest Foods are comprehensive and\nholistic as well! If you consider the World’s Healthiest Foods as a\ngroup, you will discover that their nutrients support every aspect of\nour metabolic and cellular needs. Not only do they maintain this\nmassive underlying biochemical structure that supports all of our\nhealth, but they do so in an optimal way by combining nutrients in\ntheir most natural patterns. No supplement will ever be able to\nachieve this amazing level of synergy between nutrients! All you have to do is focus on enjoying the World’s Healthiest Foods since\ntheir nutrient-richness and natural synergy of nutrients will do the\nrest of the work for you. \n\n3.2Why Health and Healthy Weight Becomes Challenged When You Don’t Get Enough Nutrient-Rich World’s Healthiest Foods\n The modern American diet is often criticized as being a diet that is\nprone to excess. Too many fats, too many sweets, too much fried\nfood, too much salt, too much meat, and too many calories! Many\nhealth analysts think about obesity in precisely this way—as a problem\nresulting from excess and overconsumption.\nYet the opposite side of the equation when it comes to health and\nmaintaining a healthy weight—the side involving underconsumption\nand nutrient deficiency—is equally true. The American diet is just\nas much one of deficiency and undernourishment. The average U.S.\nadult consumes a daily diet that fails to provide 100% of the Dietary\nReference Intake (DRI) level for:\nvitamin A\nvitamin K\ncholine\nIt also provides less than 50% of the DRI for:\nvitamin D\nfolate\ncalcium\nmagnesium\nselenium\nfiber\nthe omega-3 fatty acid, EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid)\nthe omega-3 fatty acid, DHA (docosahexaenoic acid)\nWhat happens when we get this low in our nutrient intake? If it’s only\nfor a few days, usually nothing. When we are healthy, our bodies have\nnutrient reserves that they can draw upon to meet our nutritional needs.\nBut if we are low in nutrients week after week, month after month, this\nnutrient deficiency can start us off on the road to chronic disease and unhealthy weight gain. Developing a serious illness as a result of\nnutrient deficiency is not a quick or immediately visible process.\nIn the past, we have tended to think about nutrient deficiency\nconditions as involving the total absence of a single nutrient and\nfairly rapid appearance of unusual symptoms. The disease called\nscurvy that gets triggered by vitamin C deficiency is a good example.\nThis condition, which is readily visible in the form of damage to\ngums of the mouth, was originally seen in sailors in the middle of\nlong voyages without the benefit of fruits and vegetables on board.\nIn this situation, there is a fairly fast-developing and direct relationship\nbetween a single nutrient deficiency (vitamin C) and a very unique\nset of symptoms (damage to the gums).\nToday’s nutrient deficiency diseases do not fit into this scurvy type\nof pattern. Today, it is not one single nutrient that has fallen below\nthe recommended intake level. It is more like a dozen nutrients as we\nconsume all of them in amounts that fall far below the amounts we\nneed. Over a period of time involving several years, we may still not\nsee any visible signs of disease related to these nutrient deficiencies.\nInstead, we may only feel like we’re tired more often than we should\nbe. Or that we don’t sleep as soundly as we should, or don’t feel well\nrested upon waking. Or that we are fatigued and can’t concentrate well.\nOur chronic nutrient deficiency is definitely leading us in the direction\nof more serious health problems, even though we may have yet to see\nany visible evidence of these problems.\nUnderneath the surface, at a cellular level, long-term nutrient deficiency\nchanges the way our body functions. Virtually all body functions\nrequire unique combinations of nutrients. We cannot keep our cell\nmembranes intact without the help of vitamin E. We cannot protect\nthe structures inside the cell from oxygen-related damage without\nthe help of copper, zinc, and selenium. Inside the energy-producing\nmitochondria in our cells, manganese is essential. Our muscles cannot\nuse carbohydrates for fuel without a specific mixture of B-complex\nvitamins. Chronic nutrient deficiency disrupts all of these processes.\nThey don’t altogether cease, but rather continue to operate in a sub-optimal way. Over time, what starts out as sub-optimal progresses\nonward to fully problematic.",

Magnesium is also an important component\nin bone structure and plays an important role in cell-to-cell communication, especially that involving our nerve and muscle cells.\nWithout adequate amounts of magnesium, our bodies wouldn’t be\nable to function properly, which can first lead to lowered energy and\nthen potentially progress to a variety of different signs, symptoms,\nand health conditions when things aren’t working well. As you can\nalso see, it’s more complicated than simply saying that the role of\nmagnesium is to promote heart health or bone health, two claims\nthat are often associated with this mineral. Magnesium, like all other\nnutrients, is needed in hundreds of different ways for support of our\nunderlying metabolic processes, and it is these underlying processes\nthat serve as the true foundation for our overall physical health.\nYou might think that this more comprehensive and holistic view of\nhealth and nutrients would make nourishment more complicated.\nBut it’s actually the opposite! The true role of nutrients in your\nhealth actually makes things much simpler.\nThat’s because the World’s Healthiest Foods are comprehensive and\nholistic as well! If you consider the World’s Healthiest Foods as a\ngroup, you will discover that their nutrients support every aspect of\nour metabolic and cellular needs. Not only do they maintain this\nmassive underlying biochemical structure that supports all of our\nhealth, but they do so in an optimal way by combining nutrients in\ntheir most natural patterns. No supplement will ever be able to\nachieve this amazing level of synergy between nutrients! All you have to do is focus on enjoying the World’s Healthiest Foods since\ntheir nutrient-richness and natural synergy of nutrients will do the\nrest of the work for you.",

          "content": "3.23.2Why Health and Healthy Weight Becomes Challenged When You Don’t Get Enough Nutrient-Rich World’s Healthiest Foods\n The modern American diet is often criticized as being a diet that is\nprone to excess. Too many fats, too many sweets, too much fried\nfood, too much salt, too much meat, and too many calories! Many\nhealth analysts think about obesity in precisely this way—as a problem\nresulting from excess and overconsumption.\nYet the opposite side of the equation when it comes to health and\nmaintaining a healthy weight—the side involving underconsumption\nand nutrient deficiency—is equally true. The American diet is just\nas much one of deficiency and undernourishment. The average U.S.\nadult consumes a daily diet that fails to provide 100% of the Dietary\nReference Intake (DRI) level for:\nvitamin A\nvitamin K\ncholine\nIt also provides less than 50% of the DRI for:\nvitamin D\nfolate\ncalcium\nmagnesium\nselenium\nfiber\nthe omega-3 fatty acid, EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid)\nthe omega-3 fatty acid, DHA (docosahexaenoic acid)\nWhat happens when we get this low in our nutrient intake? If it’s only\nfor a few days, usually nothing. When we are healthy, our bodies have\nnutrient reserves that they can draw upon to meet our nutritional needs.\nBut if we are low in nutrients week after week, month after month, this\nnutrient deficiency can start us off on the road to chronic disease and unhealthy weight gain. Developing a serious illness as a result of\nnutrient deficiency is not a quick or immediately visible process.\nIn the past, we have tended to think about nutrient deficiency\nconditions as involving the total absence of a single nutrient and\nfairly rapid appearance of unusual symptoms. The disease called\nscurvy that gets triggered by vitamin C deficiency is a good example.\nThis condition, which is readily visible in the form of damage to\ngums of the mouth, was originally seen in sailors in the middle of\nlong voyages without the benefit of fruits and vegetables on board.\nIn this situation, there is a fairly fast-developing and direct relationship\nbetween a single nutrient deficiency (vitamin C) and a very unique\nset of symptoms (damage to the gums).\nToday’s nutrient deficiency diseases do not fit into this scurvy type\nof pattern. Today, it is not one single nutrient that has fallen below\nthe recommended intake level. It is more like a dozen nutrients as we\nconsume all of them in amounts that fall far below the amounts we\nneed. Over a period of time involving several years, we may still not\nsee any visible signs of disease related to these nutrient deficiencies.\nInstead, we may only feel like we’re tired more often than we should\nbe. Or that we don’t sleep as soundly as we should, or don’t feel well\nrested upon waking. Or that we are fatigued and can’t concentrate well.\nOur chronic nutrient deficiency is definitely leading us in the direction\nof more serious health problems, even though we may have yet to see\nany visible evidence of these problems.\nUnderneath the surface, at a cellular level, long-term nutrient deficiency\nchanges the way our body functions. Virtually all body functions\nrequire unique combinations of nutrients. We cannot keep our cell\nmembranes intact without the help of vitamin E. We cannot protect\nthe structures inside the cell from oxygen-related damage without\nthe help of copper, zinc, and selenium. Inside the energy-producing\nmitochondria in our cells, manganese is essential. Our muscles cannot\nuse carbohydrates for fuel without a specific mixture of B-complex\nvitamins. Chronic nutrient deficiency disrupts all of these processes.\nThey don’t altogether cease, but rather continue to operate in a sub-optimal way. Over time, what starts out as sub-optimal progresses\nonward to fully problematic.",

These negative reactions to specific\nfoods are more common than you might expect, and they can be\nsurprisingly difficult to pinpoint as contributing factors to health\nproblems. Adverse food reactions can include food allergies that\nstart in early childhood and continue on throughout life. They can\nalso involve more temporary reactions to food that occur when you\nare feeling particularly low in energy and when your physical health\nis especially compromised. But in either case, you will not always\nhave an easy-to-spot symptom that tells you, “Aha! My body is\nhaving a problem with something I ate.” In the case of adverse food\nreactions, it’s much more likely that you will feel bad in some way\n(i.e., fatigued, irritable, depressed, foggy headed, lethargic) that\ncould involve dozens of causes. All of the above symptoms, for\nexample, could be caused by lack of sleep, or chronic stress, or a\nlong list of psychological factors.\nWhen we have adverse food reactions, we might be reacting to several\ndifferent food components. It could be some unique food proteins\nthat are triggering our problematic reactions. It could also be the\npresence of sugars in food that we lack the enzymes to digest properly.\nWe might also react to food additives and preservatives, or to pesticides\nor other food contaminants.\nRegardless of the food component that is triggering an adverse reaction, you almost always feel better if you can eliminate the food\nfrom your meal plan (or at least substantially cut back on your\nconsumption of the food). As you will see later in this chapter, this\nprocess of avoiding potentially troublesome foods usually falls\nunder the heading of an “elimination diet.” Later in this chapter, I’ll\nbe telling you much more about the details of a modified elimination\ndiet that you can follow in your own meal planning as you pursue\nweight loss and more vibrant health.\nAdverse food reactions really boil down to a kind of mismatch\nbetween a person and a food. You and I may just not be cut out to\neat anything and everything! If you and your food are mismatched,\nyou may have a more difficult time losing weight. Recent reviews\nof popular weight loss diets clearly show that unusual diets—\nmismatched not only to a person’s nutrient needs but also to a\nperson’s broader metabolic pattern—are unsupportive of weight loss\nin comparison to balanced, metabolically matched diets. Although\nadverse food reactions have not been specifically studied in this\nregard, they are established as real-life responses to food that can\nupset many different metabolic balances in a person’s body, and can\ncompromise function in several different body systems, including\nthe digestive system, immune system, nervous system, endocrine\nsystem, and inflammatory system. If these body systems are not\nworking well, your path to healthy and optimal weight loss will be\ncompromised.\nTwo important examples of adverse food reactions—not specifically\nlinked to weight management problems but relatively high up on\nmost research lists of foods most likely to cause adverse reactions—\nare dairy and wheat. Here’s a closer look at each of those foods and\ntheir potential for adverse reactions.\nIn the case of dairy, as many as 15% of all U.S. infants show unwanted\nreactions to cow’s milk, including common symptoms that can be\nrelated to many other factors besides food. These symptoms include\nirritableness, fussiness, upset stomach, and bowel problems like excessive gas, bloating, or diarrhea. When tested for food allergy,\nhowever, as few as 5% of all infants actually test positive for cow’s\nmilk allergy. The frequency of dairy allergy in adults has been estimated in some studies to be similar to the frequency in children, and\nin other studies to be somewhat lower. (As is the case for all food\nallergies, we do not have very accurate data to estimate the number\nof people actually affected.)\nIn the case of dairy, sometimes the adverse reaction is related to milk\nsugar (lactose). Not all individuals have enough of the enzyme\nlactase to break down milk sugar and allow it to digest properly.\nUnfortunately, in the processed food world, milk sugar (lactose) is\noften added to non-dairy foods for flavor, and the only way to avoid\nit is to read the ingredient list on the package. Sliced deli meats,\npowdered coffee creamers, and ready-to-eat baked goods are examples\nof foods that can contain lactose. Many individuals also have allergic\nreactions to special proteins in cow’s milk called caseins. Unfortunately, in the processed food world, these proteins are also frequently\nfound in a wide variety of foods in forms like calcium caseinate or\nsodium caseinate. Hot dogs, deli meats, nutrition bars, and protein\npowder drinks are examples of foods that can contain casein. Individuals who experience adverse reactions to dairy often feel like\ntheir entirely dietary balance is affected. The consequences of\nconsuming dairy can detract too much from the satisfaction of\neating, or lead to confusion about the trustworthiness of the diet.\nUnder these circumstances, the challenges of weight management\noften become more difficult.\nIn the case of wheat, there is even less conclusive research on adverse\nfood reactions than there is for dairy. But scientists continue to\ninvestigate links between specific wheat proteins, including gliadin\nproteins and lectins (especially WGA, or wheat germ agglutinin)\nand their ability to cause adverse reactions. Much like the situation\nfor lactose and casein in dairy, wheat components find their way into\nmany types of processed foods, and it is possible to experience an\nadverse reaction to wheat even if you do not eat foods like wheat.\n\n4.2Elimination Diet\n I have seen that adverse food reactions can be a barrier to losing\nweight. As such, when you embark on your Healthy Weight Loss, if\nyou find that after three weeks of focusing your diet on enjoying\nthe World’s Healthiest Foods you don’t lose any weight, you may\nwant to investigate whether adverse food reactions may be the\nculprit.\nWhat I would recommend in this situation is a modified elimination\ndiet. One of the best tools to use for this is to keep a journal. Write\ndown all the foods that eat each meal, and then when you reintroduce\neliminated foods, write down whether or not you notice experiencing\nan adverse reaction to them.\nI realize that you’ll need the help of a licensed healthcare practitioner\nto diagnose or treat a food allergy, and that you will also need the\nsupport of a healthcare practitioner to go on a full-fledged, nutritionally restrictive or nutritionally complicated elimination diet. (I\nshould also point out here that in the case of some full-blown\nelimination diets, medical monitoring is important from a safety\nstandpoint.) But I am not talking about a full-blown elimination diet\nin this situation. I am only talking about some practical steps you\ncan take to experiment with avoidance of foods that are most\ncommonly associated with adverse food reactions. The chart below\nshows the foods that are less likely to be associated with these kinds\nof problematic reactions.You’ll have to decide how comfortable you are restricting your food\nintake to the above list. If you are worried about staying well-nourished on the above foods, you should consult with a healthcare practitioner rather than attempting these dietary changes on your own.\nYou aren’t likely to see many changes in your health or well-being\nunless you stick with these food modifications for at least one week,\nso you need to feel comfortable in sticking to this restricted meal\nplan for that amount of time. At the end of one week, you will want\nto start re-introducing old foods back into your meal plan. I recommend that you introduce only one food at a time, and that you wait\nat least two days before re-introducing another food. I would also\nrecommend that you start with asparagus, avocados, beets, broccoli,\nBrussels sprouts, cauliflower, cucumbers, blueberries, watermelon,\nflaxseeds, and quinoa when starting this food re-introduction\nprocess since they are not as commonly associated with adverse\nfood reactions as some of the other foods you might have eliminated\nfrom your meal plan.After that, you will want to continue re-introducing other foods back\ninto your meal plan, on this same one-per-day basis and waiting at\nleast two days before you add the next food. While you are re-introducing the foods that you avoided during your week on the modified\nelimination diet, try to notice any adverse reactions that you may\nhave. Try to pay special attention to any problems that prompted\nyou to experiment with food elimination in the first place. If these\nproblems return, it might be evidence that the newly re-introduced\nfood is not well-matched for your body’s metabolism and might be\nworth avoiding in future meal planning.\nIf you do suspect any adverse reactions using this modified elimination\napproach, you should definitely consider a consultation with a\nnutritionist or other healthcare provider who has extensive experience\nwith food allergy. A more structured elimination-challenge diet\nmight also be important to consider. For more information on food\nallergy and sensitivity, see page 719 of The World’s Healthiest Foods\nbook.",

While “fat burning” may sound\nlike a fairly simple process, it is anything but.\nIn chemical terms, “fat burning” means oxidation of fat. In order to\nbreakdown body fat and turn it into energy, many different enzymes\nand nutrients are required. Directly involved in this process are the\nvitamins B2 (riboflavin), B3 (niacin), and B5 (pantothenic acid).\nAlso involved are proteins, together with sulfur- and phosphoruscontaining molecules. If our food fails to provide us with an ample\nsupply of these fat-metabolizing nutrients, we are not going to burn\nbody fat in an optimal way. That’s why it’s so important to focus on\nnutrient-rich World’s Healthiest Foods—for their concentration of\nthese and other nutrients—when looking to optimize healthy weight\nloss.\nThere is also some preliminary research on the role of certain nutrients\nto induce “thermogenesis” in brown fat cells. The World’s Healthiest\nFoods—notably those that provide higher protein and lower refined\ncarbohydrates, as well as those rich in fiber—are integral to activating\nthe thermogenic production of heat in brown adipose (fat) cells. In\naddition, they decrease storage of dietary fat in ordinary cells;\ntherefore, they may be helpful aspects to consider in the process of\nweight loss or any aspect of weight management.\nOne of the foods (well, actually beverages) that I emphasize in the Healthy Weight Loss Eating Plan that has made headlines when it\ncomes to its role in healthy weight loss is green tea, which contains\nmajor components that may help to promote fat loss: catechins,\ncaffeine, and theanine. Studies suggest that green tea compounds\nmay help promote fat loss by inhibiting both gastric and pancreatic\nlipase, the enzymes that digest triglycerides, and synthetase, the\nenzyme responsible for synthesizing fatty acids into the form in\nwhich they can be stored in the body’s adipose (fat) cells. It is for\nthis reason—as well as the fact that green tea’s antioxidant concentration has been found to be health promoting on many levels—that\nI emphasize its consumption in the Healthy Weight Loss Eating\nPlan.

While “fat burning” may sound\nlike a fairly simple process, it is anything but.\nIn chemical terms, “fat burning” means oxidation of fat. In order to\nbreakdown body fat and turn it into energy, many different enzymes\nand nutrients are required. Directly involved in this process are the\nvitamins B2 (riboflavin), B3 (niacin), and B5 (pantothenic acid).\nAlso involved are proteins, together with sulfur- and phosphoruscontaining molecules. If our food fails to provide us with an ample\nsupply of these fat-metabolizing nutrients, we are not going to burn\nbody fat in an optimal way. That’s why it’s so important to focus on\nnutrient-rich World’s Healthiest Foods—for their concentration of\nthese and other nutrients—when looking to optimize healthy weight\nloss.\nThere is also some preliminary research on the role of certain nutrients\nto induce “thermogenesis” in brown fat cells. The World’s Healthiest\nFoods—notably those that provide higher protein and lower refined\ncarbohydrates, as well as those rich in fiber—are integral to activating\nthe thermogenic production of heat in brown adipose (fat) cells. In\naddition, they decrease storage of dietary fat in ordinary cells;\ntherefore, they may be helpful aspects to consider in the process of\nweight loss or any aspect of weight management.\nOne of the foods (well, actually beverages) that I emphasize in the Healthy Weight Loss Eating Plan that has made headlines when it\ncomes to its role in healthy weight loss is green tea, which contains\nmajor components that may help to promote fat loss: catechins,\ncaffeine, and theanine. Studies suggest that green tea compounds\nmay help promote fat loss by inhibiting both gastric and pancreatic\nlipase, the enzymes that digest triglycerides, and synthetase, the\nenzyme responsible for synthesizing fatty acids into the form in\nwhich they can be stored in the body’s adipose (fat) cells. It is for\nthis reason—as well as the fact that green tea’s antioxidant concentration has been found to be health promoting on many levels—that\nI emphasize its consumption in the Healthy Weight Loss Eating\nPlan.

That’s because if there is any compromise\nin your digestion, unwanted molecules (like toxic residues or allergycausing substances) can sometimes get absorbed into the blood\nstream and trigger unwanted inflammatory responses.While all nutrients are important to maintaining digestive health,\nfollowing are a few of the health-promoting nutrients found in the\nWorld’s Healthiest Foods that have been singled out for their special\ncontribution.\nDietary Fiber\nAt the top of many lists for digestive tract support is dietary fiber.\nYour food simply cannot pass through you in an optimal way unless\nit contains fiber. Ideally, we should have at least 10 grams of fiber\nwith every meal and at least 5 grams with every snack, although 20\ngrams per meal and 10 grams per snack would also be helpful to\nmost of our digestive tracts. Whole, unprocessed foods are essential\nfor adequate fiber. Of special importance are World’s Healthiest\nFoods such as vegetables, legumes (like beans or lentils) and whole\ngrains. The skins of fruit are also rich in fiber. Fiber helps keep food\nmoving through our intestines at a gradual pace—not too fast and\nnot too slow.\nGlutamine\nAlthough not as well known in the conventional world of nutrition,\nglutamine is an amino acid that serves as one of the primary fuels\nfor cells that line our small intestine. It can be made from other\namino acids found in food or in our body, but it is also found\npreformed in a variety of World’s Healthiest Foods, including cabbage,\nbeets, beef, chicken, fish, beans, and dairy products.\nShort Chain Fatty Acids\nLike glutamine, short chain fatty acids (or SCFAs) are not wellknown in the conventional world of nutrition, but these key nutrients\nserve as preferred fuels for cells that line our large intestine. If these\ncells do not have adequate energy, they cannot process our food\nproperly. SCFAs are formed by bacteria in our small intestine when\nthese bacteria process starches (especially resistant starches) and\nseveral other types of carbohydrate-related molecules found in our\nfood. World’s Healthiest Foods such as whole grains like corn, oats,\nwheat, rye, and brown rice; fruits such as apples and citrus fruits;and all legumes are good sources of resistant starch and non-starch\ncarbohydrates that our intestinal bacteria can convert into SCFAs. \n\n7.2Digestive-Health Nutrients\n The process of digestion and absorption is a complicated one that\ninvolves dozens of different cell types, dozens of different enzymes,\nthe movement of smooth muscles around our intestines, and the\ntrigger of these muscles by our nerves. It’s literally impossible to\nname a single vitamin or mineral that does not play a role either directly or indirectly in some aspect of digestive health. For this reason, foods with the greatest concentration of nutrients and greatest\nvariety of nutrients are optimal for digestive support. The World’s\nHealthiest Foods fit this description exactly because they have all\nbeen chosen on the basis of nutrient-richness.

      "content": "Chapter 9\n9.1World’s Healthiest Foods Balance Blood Sugar Levels \n Keeping Blood Sugar Balanced\nGlucose—a type of sugar found in our blood—is a necessary nutrient\nfor many cells, especially the brain. An essential feature of maintaining health is to have balanced blood glucose levels. If these levels\nare too low, our cells may not be properly nourished. If these levels\nare too high, metabolic consequences can occur which can lead to\ndamage to the kidneys, arteries, and other body systems. High blood\nglucose levels also usually reflect that the cells are not being able to\ntake in the glucose and therefore are not getting the energy they need\nfor normal function.\nWhen we speak about blood sugar, we are not talking about the\nsame type of sugar as you find as table sugar. Blood sugar is glucose,\na simple sugar that others can be broken down into.\nAt every moment of every day, our blood sugar level is shifting\nslightly. Eating a meal can shift our blood sugar level dramatically—\ndepending, of course, on which foods we eat and how thoroughly we\nare able to chew and digest them. It’s natural for our blood sugar to\nincrease after a meal. However, it’s unnatural for it to increase beyond certain limits. Similarly, between meals, it is natural for our\nblood sugar to drop. But excessive drops are problematic.\nIf we eat in a way that turns our blood sugar balance into a rollercoaster ride, we risk several unwanted consequences, including the\npossibility of unwanted weight gain. The connection between large\nblood sugar swings and potential weight gain is fairly simple. If our blood sugar goes up too dramatically and then drops, we may\nexperience this drop-off as a need for more food to raise our blood\nsugar back up again, often to its elevated level. Similarly, if we go\ntoo long without eating and our blood sugar “bottoms out” at an\nexcessively low level, we may feel desperate for whatever we can get\nour hands on. In either direction, the rollercoaster ride can spell\ntrouble for excess eating.\nIf we get caught up in large pendulum swings with our blood sugar,\nwe are more likely to want high-sugar, high-calorie, and nutrientpoor foods. That situation can only increase our risk of unwanted\nweight gain.\nProcessed foods with high levels of simple sugar will spike our\nblood sugar up more quickly than whole, natural foods. These\nprocessed foods are often storehouses of refined carbohydrates,\nalmost never contain enough fiber to balance digestion and provide\nfor a very gradual breakdown and release of carbohydrates into our\ndigestive tract, and are usually deficient in the vitamins and minerals\nneeded to support insulin production and the uptake of glucose into\nour cells. This can trigger a yo-yo effect in our blood sugar levels and\nalso increase our risk of unwanted weight gain.\nNutrient-rich World’s Healthiest Foods contain a wealth of vitamins,\nminerals, fiber, and other health-promoting compounds that can help\nus maintain optimal blood sugar regulation. They are rich in fiber,\nwhich steadies the speed of digestion. They contain chromium and\nvitamin B3, which are involved in the process of insulin metabolism\nand the ability of this hormone to clear sugar from our bloodstream.\nMany nutrient-rich World’s Healthiest Foods are also storehouses\nof zinc, a mineral that plays an important role in blood sugar balance.\nSo, you can see how eating nutrient-rich World’s Healthiest Foods\ncan help to keep your blood sugar on par. Not only will this nutrient\ncontribution help with your ability to lose weight but it will also\nprovide you with great overall health benefits since excess blood sugar levels can lead to insulin resistance, a condition that we now\nrecognize as a critical factor in the development of many health\nconditions.\n\n9.2Insulin Resistance\n Health scientists have always looked at the process of developing a\nchronic disease—like obesity, or diabetes, or high blood pressure—\nas being a complicated one that involves many factors. One of the\nmost prominent factors in this mix is insulin resistance. In the year\n2007 alone, over 900 research studies focused exclusively on insulin\nresistance and its relationship to long-term health. Insulin resistance\nhas become so important in our understanding of health that it is no\nlonger possible to understand a simple process like chronic weight\ngain without considering insulin resistance and its potential role in\nthe process.\nHow Insulin Resistance Becomes a Problem\nThe most common source of energy in our body is sugar (glucose.)\nWhen our cells need energy, sugar is the fuel they depend on most\noften. The sugar needed by our cells is constantly flowing through\nour blood. However, the help of insulin—a protein hormone made\nby our pancreas—is usually required in order for sugar to leave our\nbloodstream and flow into our cells. Insulin resistance is a situation\nin which this process breaks down and our cells stop responding\neffectively to the insulin produced by our pancreas. Our pancreas\nmay make an unusually high amount of insulin in an effort to get\nsugar into our cells. But insulin resistance prevents this effort from\nbeing fully effective because the actions of insulin continue to be\nresisted in some way. “Insulin resistance” is the name given to this\nunwanted set of events. Insulin resistance can become more than just\ntemporary—it can become an everyday roadblock to health.\nHow Insulin Resistance Affects Weight Management\nThere is not one simple, easy-to-describe relationship between insulin\nresistance and body weight. But there are several easy-to-describe\nfeatures. First, excess body weight in the form of excess fat—particularly around the middle (or abdomen)—is closely related to development\nof insulin resistance. Particularly when a man has a waist circumference of more than 40 inches or a woman’s is 35 inches or more,\ninsulin resistance is significantly more likely to occur.\nHow does excess abdominal fat help to trigger insulin resistance?\nResearchers are not entirely certain about this set of events. Traditionally, all of the research on insulin and blood sugar balance has\nfocused on muscle rather than fat. When insulin helps sugar leave the\nbloodstream, it usually helps sugar enter a muscle cell—not a fat\ncell.\nUntil recently, the role of fat cells in blood sugar balance has been\noverlooked because the muscles have been viewed as so very important\nin receiving sugar from the blood. Current research, however, has\nmade it clear that fat cells (called adipose tissue) also play a key role\nin insulin metabolism and blood sugar regulation. One of these connections, as described in the chapter on inflammation, is related to\nthe fact that overly fatty fat cells start making insufficient amounts\nof adiponectin, a protein that helps insulin to lock onto cells and\nescort sugar out of our blood. When adiponectin is in short supply,\ntoo much sugar can remain in the blood, causing our pancreas to\nproduce more insulin in an effort to compensate. But the true problem\ncannot be solved by more insulin. The true problem is insulin resistance—in this case, being caused by too much abdominal body fat.\nInsulin Resistance and the Tendency to Become Overweight\nJust as too much abdominal fat can increase our tendency to develop\ninsulin resistance, insulin resistance can increase our tendency to\nbecome overweight. Particularly in women who are lean and have\nlower amounts of total body fat, insulin resistance increases the\nchance of weight gain and obesity. Women who have gone through\nmenopause also have increased risk of weight gain following the\ndevelopment of insulin resistance. In women who are already obese,\nhowever, insulin resistance may actually protect against weight gain\nand make weight loss easier. Finally, there is some fascinating research showing that individuals who develop insulin resistance—\nand at the same time obtain a high percent of their total calories\nfrom fat—have a greater chance of gaining weight and becoming\nobese than individuals who have insulin resistance but obtain only\na moderate percent of total calories from fat.\n\n9.3How the World’s Healthiest Foods Can Help Prevent Insulin Resistance and Unwanted Weight Gain\n There are three basic ways in which your diet can help prevent insulin\nresistance. Fortunately, the World’s Healthiest Foods can help you\nin each of these three basic ways.\nFirst is the task of avoiding, or getting rid of, excess abdominal fat.\n(If you are already overweight and already have increased fat around\nthe middle section, you will still want to avoid the addition of more\nabdominal fat.) Since the risk of insulin resistance increases as the\namount of abdominal fat gets larger, this step seems like an important\none. So even if you’ve already got too much fat around the middle\nsection, or if your waistline is fine and you are simply trying to avoid\nunwanted weight gain around your middle, you’ll want make the\nWorld’s Healthiest Foods more of a priority in your diet since they\nare the key to reduced risk of insulin resistance. Even though there is\nno way to “spot reduce” and lose fat pounds exclusively from your\nmiddle section, overall weight loss will include loss of fat from your\nmiddle section, and you can accomplish this overall weight loss\nmost effectively with nutrient-rich World’s Healthiest Foods.\nSecond is the task of avoiding a high-fat diet. People who develop\ninsulin resistance—and at the same time obtain a high percent of\ntheir total calories from fat—have a greater chance of gaining\nweight than people who have insulin resistance but obtain only a\nmoderate percent of total calories from fat. As you’ll see, the menus\nthat I provide in the Healthy Weight Loss Eating Plan provide an\naverage of 249 total calories from fat. This is ideal for moderating fat\nintake and keeping the risk of weight gain down from an insulin resistance standpoint.Third, and perhaps most important, is steadying your blood sugar\nas much as possible by the way you eat. Here the World’s Healthiest\nFoods can help you in a variety of ways. High-fiber foods are essential\nfor stabilizing your blood sugar because they help regulate the pace\nof your digestion. And since most of the World’s Healthiest Foods\nare plant-based foods they are naturally rich in fiber.\nAlso important for stabilizing blood sugar are protein-rich foods.\nProtein digests at a moderate pace that is easy on blood sugar levels.\nThe lean meats, fish, low-fat dairy foods, legumes, and most of the\nnuts and seeds included as World’s Healthiest Foods are considered\nrich protein sources. Once again, the recipes included in the Healthy\nWeight Loss Eating Plan frequently feature these protein-rich foods.\nFinally, nothing is harder on our blood sugar levels than a diet filled\nwith highly processed foods in which the fiber, vitamins, and minerals\nhave been largely removed through processing. Since the Healthy\nWeight Loss – Without Dieting emphasizes World’s Healthiest Foods\nit keeps these processed foods out of your mainstream meal plan,\nand in this way, it pays huge dividends in terms of blood sugar balance.\n\n9.4Maintaining Balanced Blood Sugar Levels by Choosing Foods Based on the Glycemic Index\n It’s important to remember that not all foods, not even all of the\nWorld’s Healthiest Foods, are created alike when it comes to their\neffects on our blood sugar. Some foods can cause stark spikes while\nothers keep circulating blood sugar levels on a relatively even keel.\nThe Glycemic Index (GI) is a numerical scale used to indicate how\nfast and how high a particular food can raise our blood glucose\n(blood sugar) level. A food with a low GI will typically prompt a\nmoderate rise in blood glucose, while a food with a high GI may\ncause our blood glucose level to increase above the optimal level.\nSelecting foods based on their GI is a great way to control fluctuations\nin your blood sugar levels An awareness of foods’ GI can help you control your blood sugar\nlevels, and by doing so, may help you to achieve or maintain a\nhealthy weight, let alone prevent heart disease, improve cholesterol\nlevels, and prevent insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and certain\ncancers. A substantial amount of research suggests a low-GI diet\nprovides these significant health benefits and can be a helpful\ncomponent of a healthy weight loss approach.\nThe following chart details the GI of the World’s Healthiest Foods.\nNext to each food you will find a classification, which are based\nupon the Canadian Diabetes Association’s ranking of GI and their\nthreshold points. Therefore, in this chart, very low is associated with\nfoods that have a GI of 20 or less, low with a GI of 55 or less,\nmedium with a GI of 56-69, and high with a GI of 70 or greater.",

However, the help of insulin—a protein hormone made\nby our pancreas—is usually required in order for sugar to leave our\nbloodstream and flow into our cells. Insulin resistance is a situation\nin which this process breaks down and our cells stop responding\neffectively to the insulin produced by our pancreas. Our pancreas\nmay make an unusually high amount of insulin in an effort to get\nsugar into our cells. But insulin resistance prevents this effort from\nbeing fully effective because the actions of insulin continue to be\nresisted in some way. “Insulin resistance” is the name given to this\nunwanted set of events. Insulin resistance can become more than just\ntemporary—it can become an everyday roadblock to health.\nHow Insulin Resistance Affects Weight Management\nThere is not one simple, easy-to-describe relationship between insulin\nresistance and body weight. But there are several easy-to-describe\nfeatures. First, excess body weight in the form of excess fat—particularly around the middle (or abdomen)—is closely related to development\nof insulin resistance. Particularly when a man has a waist circumference of more than 40 inches or a woman’s is 35 inches or more,\ninsulin resistance is significantly more likely to occur.\nHow does excess abdominal fat help to trigger insulin resistance?\nResearchers are not entirely certain about this set of events. Traditionally, all of the research on insulin and blood sugar balance has\nfocused on muscle rather than fat. When insulin helps sugar leave the\nbloodstream, it usually helps sugar enter a muscle cell—not a fat\ncell.\nUntil recently, the role of fat cells in blood sugar balance has been\noverlooked because the muscles have been viewed as so very important\nin receiving sugar from the blood. Current research, however, has\nmade it clear that fat cells (called adipose tissue) also play a key role\nin insulin metabolism and blood sugar regulation. One of these connections, as described in the chapter on inflammation, is related to\nthe fact that overly fatty fat cells start making insufficient amounts\nof adiponectin, a protein that helps insulin to lock onto cells and\nescort sugar out of our blood. When adiponectin is in short supply,\ntoo much sugar can remain in the blood, causing our pancreas to\nproduce more insulin in an effort to compensate. But the true problem\ncannot be solved by more insulin. The true problem is insulin resistance—in this case, being caused by too much abdominal body fat.\nInsulin Resistance and the Tendency to Become Overweight\nJust as too much abdominal fat can increase our tendency to develop\ninsulin resistance, insulin resistance can increase our tendency to\nbecome overweight. Particularly in women who are lean and have\nlower amounts of total body fat, insulin resistance increases the\nchance of weight gain and obesity. Women who have gone through\nmenopause also have increased risk of weight gain following the\ndevelopment of insulin resistance. In women who are already obese,\nhowever, insulin resistance may actually protect against weight gain\nand make weight loss easier. Finally, there is some fascinating research showing that individuals who develop insulin resistance—\nand at the same time obtain a high percent of their total calories\nfrom fat—have a greater chance of gaining weight and becoming\nobese than individuals who have insulin resistance but obtain only\na moderate percent of total calories from fat.",

          "content": "9.39.3How the World’s Healthiest Foods Can Help Prevent Insulin Resistance and Unwanted Weight Gain\n There are three basic ways in which your diet can help prevent insulin\nresistance. Fortunately, the World’s Healthiest Foods can help you\nin each of these three basic ways.\nFirst is the task of avoiding, or getting rid of, excess abdominal fat.\n(If you are already overweight and already have increased fat around\nthe middle section, you will still want to avoid the addition of more\nabdominal fat.) Since the risk of insulin resistance increases as the\namount of abdominal fat gets larger, this step seems like an important\none. So even if you’ve already got too much fat around the middle\nsection, or if your waistline is fine and you are simply trying to avoid\nunwanted weight gain around your middle, you’ll want make the\nWorld’s Healthiest Foods more of a priority in your diet since they\nare the key to reduced risk of insulin resistance. Even though there is\nno way to “spot reduce” and lose fat pounds exclusively from your\nmiddle section, overall weight loss will include loss of fat from your\nmiddle section, and you can accomplish this overall weight loss\nmost effectively with nutrient-rich World’s Healthiest Foods.\nSecond is the task of avoiding a high-fat diet. People who develop\ninsulin resistance—and at the same time obtain a high percent of\ntheir total calories from fat—have a greater chance of gaining\nweight than people who have insulin resistance but obtain only a\nmoderate percent of total calories from fat. As you’ll see, the menus\nthat I provide in the Healthy Weight Loss Eating Plan provide an\naverage of 249 total calories from fat. This is ideal for moderating fat\nintake and keeping the risk of weight gain down from an insulin resistance standpoint.Third, and perhaps most important, is steadying your blood sugar\nas much as possible by the way you eat. Here the World’s Healthiest\nFoods can help you in a variety of ways. High-fiber foods are essential\nfor stabilizing your blood sugar because they help regulate the pace\nof your digestion. And since most of the World’s Healthiest Foods\nare plant-based foods they are naturally rich in fiber.\nAlso important for stabilizing blood sugar are protein-rich foods.\nProtein digests at a moderate pace that is easy on blood sugar levels.\nThe lean meats, fish, low-fat dairy foods, legumes, and most of the\nnuts and seeds included as World’s Healthiest Foods are considered\nrich protein sources. Once again, the recipes included in the Healthy\nWeight Loss Eating Plan frequently feature these protein-rich foods.\nFinally, nothing is harder on our blood sugar levels than a diet filled\nwith highly processed foods in which the fiber, vitamins, and minerals\nhave been largely removed through processing. Since the Healthy\nWeight Loss – Without Dieting emphasizes World’s Healthiest Foods\nit keeps these processed foods out of your mainstream meal plan,\nand in this way, it pays huge dividends in terms of blood sugar balance.",

Some foods can cause stark spikes while\nothers keep circulating blood sugar levels on a relatively even keel.\nThe Glycemic Index (GI) is a numerical scale used to indicate how\nfast and how high a particular food can raise our blood glucose\n(blood sugar) level. A food with a low GI will typically prompt a\nmoderate rise in blood glucose, while a food with a high GI may\ncause our blood glucose level to increase above the optimal level.\nSelecting foods based on their GI is a great way to control fluctuations\nin your blood sugar levels An awareness of foods’ GI can help you control your blood sugar\nlevels, and by doing so, may help you to achieve or maintain a\nhealthy weight, let alone prevent heart disease, improve cholesterol\nlevels, and prevent insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and certain\ncancers. A substantial amount of research suggests a low-GI diet\nprovides these significant health benefits and can be a helpful\ncomponent of a healthy weight loss approach.\nThe following chart details the GI of the World’s Healthiest Foods.\nNext to each food you will find a classification, which are based\nupon the Canadian Diabetes Association’s ranking of GI and their\nthreshold points.

Inflammation, in general, is not bad and we don’t want to\nstop the entirety of inflammatory mechanisms in our body if we want\nto promote good health. What we want to do is control inflammation\nand not have excess inflammation occurring in our body. It is\nimbalanced inflammation that can propagate health conditions and\nrelated symptoms as well as that which plays a role in weight\nmanagement.\n\n10.2Reducing Fat Storage Cells and Controlling Inflammation\n The study of fat cells and their role in health has produced some\ngreat surprises in the past 10 years, including the knowledge that fat\ncells are anything but inactive storage spots for fat. We are used to\nthinking of our body fat as “just sitting there,” placing extra weight on our bones, and stressing our heart and joints from the sheer extra\npoundage.\nWhat we have learned in the past 10 years is that fat cells are\nmetabolically active, and when too much fat is stored up inside\nthem, they go to work sending off messages that act to increase\ninflammation and inflammatory problems. Some of the messaging\nmolecules that signal inflammation are only produced in overly fatty\nfat cells! Conversely, fat cells are also capable of producing anti-inflammatory molecules, and production of these molecules can be\nreduced when the fat cells become overloaded with fat.\nYou may already have heard about a weight loss program called The\nFat Resistance Diet by Dr. Leo Galland (Broadway Books, 2005) or\na second weight loss approach called UltraMetabolism: The Simple\nPlan for Automatic Weight Loss by Dr. Mark Hyman (Scribner,\n2006). Both of these programs recognize several newly found\nconnections between weight management, our brains, our fat cells,\nand inflammation. There are a good number of important and cuttingedge facts that you are going to want to consider in your healthy\nweight loss planning when it comes to inflammation. For this\nreason, I am going to tell you about this inflammation story in a more\ndetailed way.\n\n10.3Understanding Fat Cells and Leptin\n Leptin is a particularly important molecule that our fat cells produce.\nWhen we have too little fat stored up inside our fat cells, our fat\ncells cut way back on their production of leptin.\nThe reverse set of events holds true when we overeat and our fat\nstores become too great. Under those conditions, our fat cells start\nto produce more and more leptin. The increased production of\nleptin in turn will trigger two sets of events: it will decrease our\nappetite and it will increase our body’s ability to burn fat.\nAt this point in the story, we have come to the role of inflammation It turns out that most people who have too much fat stored up in\ntheir fat cells also have plenty of leptin. Their fat cells seem to do a\ngood job when it comes to increasing production of leptin when this\nmolecule is needed to help lower appetite and increase fat burning.\nHowever, despite having this plentiful supply of leptin, the leptin\ndoes not seem to do its job effectively. The appetite reduction and\nincreased fat burn do not seem to take place, even though there is\nmore leptin being produced. This clearly problematic situation is\ncalled leptin resistance. Our bodies seem to resist the effects of leptin,\neven though they would definitely benefit if leptin could do its job.\nResearch studies make it clear that inflammation is one factor that\ncan contribute to leptin resistance. In fact, it may be the major factor\ninvolved with leptin resistance for many individuals. Although it is\nnot yet clear exactly how the two are connected, individuals with\nchronic, low-grade inflammation are at greater risk for leptin\nresistance. Anyone living or eating in a way that increases their risk\nof chronic, unwanted inflammation is also increasing their risk of\nappetite problems and fat-burning problems due to this problem of\nleptin resistance. This set of facts is one clear reason to why a\nHealthiest Way of Eating includes a significant amount of foods that\nhave anti-inflammatory properties.\n\n10.4Adiponectin Can Also Impact Weight Loss\n Like leptin, adiponectin is a regulatory molecule produced by our fat\ncells. Unlike leptin, however, adiponectin will be produced in lower\nsupplies (not greater supplies) by our fat cells when we overeat and\nstart storing up too much unwanted body fat. Adiponectin acts somewhat like a “fat protector,” making sure that enough fat will be\naround in times of short energy supplies. However, excessive and\ncontinual overeating that results in chronic deficiency of adiponectin\nis harmful, not helpful, to our health.\nAdiponectin is one of the anti-inflammatory fat-cell-produced\nmolecules that suffers when fat cells become overly loaded with fat.And when the production of adiponectin drops, the body’s ability to\nbalance blood sugar also drops. The reason is simple. Adiponectin\nproduced by fat cells is a protein that helps insulin bind onto cells\nand encourages the flow of sugar out of the bloodstream and into\nthe cells. When fat cells stop producing enough adiponectin, too\nmuch sugar stays in the blood.\n\n10.5Food Choices Can Help Prevent Inflammation\n Always keep in mind that what you eat can help with inflammation\nin three different ways. These three aspects are taken into consideration\nin the Healthy Weight Loss Eating Plan, which will show you examples\nof how to construct a nutrient-rich way of eating that helps to keep\ninflammation in check.\nFirst, what you eat can be adjusted to avoid deficiency of antiinflammatory nutrients. An inadequate supply of omega-3 fatty\nacids, for example, can increase the risk of chronic inflammation.\nBy adjusting the diet to include more omega-3s, the risk of chronic\ninflammation can be lowered.\nSecond, what you eat can be adjusted to avoid triggering too much\ninflammation. Since toxins found in food can serve as inflammatory\ntriggers, you can lower your risk of unwanted and chronic inflammation\nby eliminating these toxins from your meal plan as much as possible\nFinally, a diet can be adjusted to avoid imbalances that trigger chronic\ninflammation. A diet that contains too many processed foods, for\nexample, will provide too many calories in the form of simple sugars\nand too few calories from nutrient-rich foods. By shifting the balance\nin this area, unwanted inflammation can become less likely. Let’s\nlook at some basic dos and don’ts in each of these three areas.\n\n10.6Getting Plenty of Anti-Inflammatory Nutrients\n At the top of the list for anti-inflammatory nutrients are two broad\ngroups of phytonutrients called flavonoids and carotenoids. Many\nflavonoids and carotenoids have strong anti-inflammatory properties,\nwhich are often unique to the specific food involved. Richly colored\nvegetables and fruits are some of your best bets here, including dark\ngreen leafy vegetables, beets, and berries. Pineapple also contains a\nproteolytic (protein-digesting) enzyme called bromelain that has\nbeen shown to have anti-inflammatory activity. These foods are\nincluded among the World’s Healthiest Foods.\nSome research studies have found that some individuals with high\nintake of flavonoids and carotenoids do not show reduced tendency\nto chronic inflammation. These studies make it clear that there are\nno “magic bullets” when it comes to dietary prevention of chronic\ndisease. While it’s important to ensure that you are getting adequate\nsupplies of carotenoids and flavonoids, this shouldn’t be at the\nexpense of other nutrients, since all are important. Yet, luckily\nsince carotenoid- and flavonoid-containing foods are also generally\nrich in so many other vitamins and minerals, they can make great\noverall contributions to your nutrient goals.\nFoods rich in omega-3 fatty acids can also be considered anti-inflammatory because omega-3 fatty acids like alpha-linolenic acid (ALA),\neicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) can\nbe converted into regulatory molecules that put the brakes on inflammation. Foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids include: fish such as\nsalmon, sardines, tuna, and other cold-water fish; and, nuts and\nseeds, especially flaxseeds, hemp seeds, and walnuts. Other foods\nthat contain omega-3s in lesser, but still very helpful, amounts include\nsoybeans, winter squash, and purslane.\nExtra virgin olive oil is another food that has been shown to have\nanti-inflammatory benefits. Some of these benefits come from oleuropein and hydroxytyrosol, two unique polyphenols found in olives.\nIt is important to note that these two phytonutrients are more concentrated in extra virgin olive than in other types of olive oil. As\nyou’ll see in the Healthy Weight Loss Eating Plan, I place a strong\nemphasis on extra virgin olive oil because it has such great health\nbenefits.",

The 4 week's worth of menus in the Plan were developed to give you a basic blueprint—a practical guideline for\nweight loss. What I hope is that you will be able to use the 4-week\nblueprint as a guideline for developing your own personalized strategy for continued healthy weight loss.\n\n11.2Who can benefit from implementation of the Plan\n The Plan was developed to improve the health of the average individual who is overweight and wants to become healthier in a way\nthat includes healthy weight loss. The Plan is not a clinical plan, and\nit is not designed to address clinical problems. You'll need to solicit\nthe help of your healthcare provider if you face any clinical issues\nin your healthcare, including any issues that might impact your\nchoice of a weight loss plan. In general, since our weight loss plan\naverages about 1,530 calories per day, we would expect it to provide the most weight loss benefit for individuals who are currently\nconsuming a substantially higher level of calories.\n\n11.3What to expect when following the Plan\n In the U.S., adults consume an average of approximately 2,100 calories of food per day. On average, U.S. adults are also overweight,\nand their intake of dietary calories is related to their overweight status. Since our weight loss plan averages about 1,530 calories per\nday, it represents a decrease of about 570 calories per day for the average U.S. adult. Over one week's period of time—and all other factors being equal—that 570-per-day calorie decrease would be\nexpected to result in a weight loss of about 1 pound. In one month,\nthe expected weight loss would be 4 pounds, and in one year, 48\npounds.\nRegardless of the weight loss plan you follow, your daily calorie intake must be matched up correctly with your activity level. If you\nconsume exactly the number of daily calories needed to complete\nyour daily activities (including exercise), you can expect to maintain\nyour current weight.

On average, U.S. adults are also overweight,\nand their intake of dietary calories is related to their overweight status. Since our weight loss plan averages about 1,530 calories per\nday, it represents a decrease of about 570 calories per day for the average U.S. adult. Over one week's period of time—and all other factors being equal—that 570-per-day calorie decrease would be\nexpected to result in a weight loss of about 1 pound. In one month,\nthe expected weight loss would be 4 pounds, and in one year, 48\npounds.\nRegardless of the weight loss plan you follow, your daily calorie intake must be matched up correctly with your activity level. If you\nconsume exactly the number of daily calories needed to complete\nyour daily activities (including exercise), you can expect to maintain\nyour current weight. If you exceed that number, you can expect to\ngain weight. If you consume fewer calories than are needed to complete your daily activities (including exercise), you can expect to\nlose weight.
